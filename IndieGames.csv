7 A mixed bag

The end of the world is a familiar thing in Surviving the Aftermath. I don’t mean that in a philosophical sense, although the exploitation of resources, warmongering, and frequent disasters have clear parallels with modern society. I mean what Surviving the Aftermath has me doing to contend with these disasters is something I’ve seen before, many times. Paradox’s survival management sim has the potential to be something special, but never builds on that to set itself apart from other, more unique games in the genre.

Your journey into the polluted wilderness starts with a set of choices. Surviving the Aftermath asks you to tailor the difficulty as you see fit, and while the available options are extensive, there’s not much context to help you know what you’re actually doing. Is 75% difficulty with a moderate chance of natural disasters and easy to please civilians a good formula? You probably won’t know in your first game, though admittedly, it’s difficult to figure out even in your second game and beyond. More extensive options or descriptions, or maybe even just preset game modes, would make this step much easier.

Happy survivors happy something that rhymes with survivors

Either way, it turns out my wish for happy survivors was a good thing. They woke up grumpy every day thanks to a lack of hygiene facilities and a dearth of drinkable water, but it had minimal effect on the settlement’s overall satisfaction. A happy side effect of confusing difficulty options or not, I appreciated the flexibility. Surviving the Aftermath adopts a minimalist approach to its tutorials that often meant I was scrambling to figure out what it expected from me

After that, it’s time to meet your specialists. Surviving the Aftermath gives you nearly a dozen unique characters with interesting backstories, and they’re the heroes of your settlement with special abilities to help in certain areas, such as fighting or scouting. I picked a scout and warrior the first time, though not because I was particularly keen on their perks. The specialist selection screen also has little context to help with your first game or two. Their identities and goals are what intrigued me.

One character lost their partner in the great catastrophe and was searching for a new life. Another wanted to help heal the physical and emotional wounds of others and work toward a brighter future.

We can be better

That’s what intrigued me about Surviving the Aftermath. No matter their background, the point was building something better and sustainable — and maybe roughing up a few dozen clans who thought differently, but that’s beside the point. There’s a special feeling of productivity and cleanness from taking raw waste such as plastic and turning it into water storage or watching people band together to create literal and metaphorical light in the dark wilderness.

You’ll have plenty of other resources, of course, and the moment-to-moment loop is familiar for anyone who’s played a management sim before — perhaps a bit too familiar. Once you’ve progressed and built a gate, your settlement can expand across the world map, encountering new dangers, people, and resources. Then it settles into the usual loop of maintaining progress, balancing expansion with conserving resources, and recovering from unexpected calamities.

A little empty

The trouble is that’s all there is. Paradox doesn’t do much else with the setting or themes. It feels as if Surviving the Aftermath is still in early access to an extent, like Paradox wanted to do more and just hasn’t yet. Aside from the specialists’ lack of importance or personality, this sense of something missing is most prominent in the mini-events that pop up occasionally.

These ask you to make a choice of some kind, though the right choice is painfully obvious in almost every case, with no consequences for making it. It’s in everyone’s best interests if you save the citizens who fell into a sinkhole, for example. I’d hoped for more interesting development with the specialists or at least some choices that had a visible effect on how a game unfolded.

Nip to the loo

The same is true for Surviving the Aftermath’s other significant features, such as upgrading facilities. It’s smart, efficient, and expected. You enhance your toilets because you need better hygiene, but upgrades add nothing unique to the experience and don’t change how you approach a round. It’s just checking off another box on the list of things you do in a management sim.

What you’re left with is a decent game, and that’s disappointing because it could have been more. For some reason, Paradox played it safe and didn’t build on its own and the game’s strengths. If you want a different take on the genre, it’s worth picking up on sale, but there are better and more interesting examples to spend your time and money on.",Surviving the Aftermath Review

6 A little flawed

Over the past year, Warpzone Studios has toiled away on updates for its Dwarven mining and colony sim Hammerting. Now the game has emerged from the Early Access caverns as the ornately crafted finished product. Well, supposedly anyway. After spelunking in the game for a while, I can’t help but feel like Hammerting needed a little more time in the forge.

It’s an intriguing premise. You take charge of a dwarven mining colony and begin plundering a massive cavern for valuable resources to craft into weapons, armour, and other tools to aid in a war that rages above ground. It’s not often that games let you be the unsung heroes in a conflict, and I was intrigued to see where the story might go. But sadly, it’s entirely surface level and merely serves as a brief explanation for your mining efforts.

But once you get into the swing of things, the lack of narrative is unlikely to be all that bothersome. You just have to reach that stage first. The game’s tutorial isn’t fantastic, dropping you into the mountain with a few pop-up boxes with reams of text and wishing you the best of luck without providing any real direction. For veterans of the genre, it’s unlikely to be a problem, but if you’re a newcomer enticed by the prospect of commanding a team of dwarven miners, it’s a rough start that will turn a few frustrated people away.

But if you stick around and push past that barrier, Hammerting houses a tonne of depth that micro-managers and lovers of creating efficient worlds will adore. The more you explore and trade with the settlements above ground, the more research tokens you will earn to unlock additional buildings and transport to improve your mining operation and see it flourish. At the start, you’ll have to watch your dwarves stroll from place to place and create rickety ladders for them to access harder to reach spots. But eventually, you can build elevators to make this more convenient and create a whole minecart railway system to transport resources quicker and easier. There’s a lot of satisfaction to be found in creating a smooth workflow.

Cosy dwellings

It looks lovely as well, thanks to the smart use of lighting. Unexplored areas are grey and foggy, with a hint of mystery and danger surrounding them, while any buildings you’ve created emit the warm glow of a cosy fire, making them truly feel like home. After making good progress, it’s enjoyable to zoom out and see how far your underground city has developed and, likewise, how much more of the underground cave system is still waiting to be explored, providing a wonderful sense of scale.

But that’s a best-case scenario. Sometimes, reaching the point where your colony is thriving is marred by several minor but irritating issues that detract from the experience. One of those problems is the dwarves themselves. Seemingly at random, their AI acts in a whole manner of bizarre ways. In Hammerting, rather than directly controlling your dwarves, you give them tasks—whether that’s mining, crafting, or battling intruders— and they’ll go about their business, in theory.

Oftentimes, they will frequently rush over to the place you’ve told them to mine or craft, do so for a few seconds and simply stop, locked in an eternal staring contest with the rock in front of them. On other occasions, they will run back and forth like they’re on fire for seemingly no reason, unable to find a path to their destination, even if they’ve been to the exact same spot before without a problem.

There are a few aspects of the game that feel fairly pointless, such as the dwarves’ individual stats. They each bring different attributes and skills to the game, but they don’t seem to matter all that much. Any dwarf is perfectly capable of completing each task, and because they’re not particularly distinct to look at, you probably won’t know who’s who anyway. When I learned that they could permanently die, I thought I would end up in an Xcom style scenario where their demise would crush my soul. Instead, I just recruited a new dwarf and moved on, which is sad. I want to care about the individuals in my colony.

Miner issues

Hammerting also has combat, though it’s not much to write home about. Now and then, your buildings will be attacked by various creatures like slimes and rats. So, you’ll need to send your dwarves over to deal with them. There are no real tactics required for this. The participants will simply stand and trade with each other until one of them perishes. The only real danger with combat is not noticing that a rat is smashing buildings to pieces because the game does a poor job of telling you they’re under attack.

A message appears in the top right-hand corner of the screen to let you know a building is damaged, but you’re more likely to be looking elsewhere, expanding your colony to help it achieve greatness. A notable change in music when a threat had arrived would be a welcome addition, particularly since the ambient soundtrack is fairly anonymous, and I quickly found myself reaching for a podcast or some other music.

Back above ground, things are fairly tedious. You can trade with settlements and provide them with materials to bolster their defences, but it’s really just a series of menus. They can give you missions, but this usually involves creating certain objects for them, and after a while, it feels like you’ve seen them all, and repetition promptly sets in.

There is plenty of fun to be had with Hammerting. The aesthetic is delightful, and when everything works as intended, time joyfully slips away. However, the aforementioned issues frequently rear their ugly heads and immediately halt the enjoyment as you’re forced to try and work around it. Despite the full release status, it still feels like Hammerting is in Early Access since it lacks the polish of some of its peers.",The Indie Game Website

4

Beginning as a project from students at the NYU Center for Games, Moncage (a portmanteau of montage and cage) has existed in one form or another since 2018. And after garnering plenty of awards and honourable mentions at places like PAX and IGF, the adventure-puzzler has finally been released in full on PC.

The world of Moncage is comprised of a montage of photographs, each of which is visible within a single side of a cube-shaped cage. The images are snapshots of significant moments in one person’s life, but for some unknown reason, they never contain any actual people.

Potential energy

Moncage’s puzzles come from adjusting your perspective so that components in two or more of the images align, at which point they interact and affect their surroundings. Sometimes the effects are limited to the images in question; other times, they affect the entire cube, and occasionally they open a door to an entirely new image. Maybe the counterweight of a set of scales on a desk will raise the arm of a crane in a construction zone, or maybe opening a hatch in the floor of a lighthouse will carry a truck across a ravine. Chaining one puzzle after another results in something resembling a Rube-Goldberg machine that spans a lifetime, with you as the catalyst.

Unfortunately, these puzzles can sometimes be frustratingly fiddly. Several times I offered an answer I was sure was correct, to no effect. Then, after spending too long trying other solutions, I would check the game’s hints only to find I was right all along, but hadn’t aligned the images precisely enough to proceed.

More damning though, is that the whole system isn’t satisfying in the way a puzzle should be. The process of solving each one almost always comes down to searching the images for two similar-looking objects, and then lining them up. Every once in a whil, the effects of a solution are delightful, touching, or surprising enough to compensate for the straightforward puzzles. (Flipping through a calendar in one image to change the weather in another is a particular highlight). But these moments are the exceptions, and they’re too few and far between.

Flattened boxes

Maybe it’s unfair to compare Moncage to one of my favourite games of the year, but while playing I couldn’t help being reminded of another game that tells its wordless story through a relatively simple puzzle mechanic, the exceptional Unpacking. But where Unpacking uses everyday objects to render its cast in intimate detail, Moncage’s snapshots lack the kind of specificity required to understand its characters as anything other than broad archetypes.

You know the main character of Moncage is enlisted as a soldier because there are grenades, helmets, and a shooting range outside a large tent. You know they’ve been severely wounded because season after season passes in a hospital room. You even know they’ve been traumatised (if that wasn’t already obvious), because the world the war has wrought looks alien to them from their seat at the bar. But these aren’t insights that help you understand them as a living person. These are passing glances–made hastily and over a long distance–at a stranger.

Only shallow

On its surface, Moncage does so many things I like. Its narrative is conveyed through interaction, rather than through text or cutscenes. Its predominant mechanic is clever. It’s short. But it stands as an example of just how easily a game can be undone by only one or two critical shortcomings. There’s a world in which a few chewy brain teasers would be enough for me to overlook some one-dimensional characters–this is a puzzle game after all. One-dimensional puzzles, though, are harder to forgive.",The Indie Game Website

7 Promising but perplexing

Before I get into the main review, I want to address the content warning Frogwares has put before you get into the game. It warns of outdated views that portray the harsh reality and mistreatment of minorities in cultures back then. It states they’re wrong, which is good, but these portrayals are still in the game. I’m not sure how I feel about this overall. On the one hand, I’m glad the warning is there, but on the other hand, the game features racism, transphobia, and classism, and I’m not certain any of this helps the story to shine.

With that out of the way, creating an ambitious detective adventure must be difficult. There are a couple of essential questions that need to be addressed and reflected on while creating each part of the mystery. For starters, are the puzzles too simple, too hard or just right? How much freedom do I have in my actions? Are there enough hints, so that I know where to go, but not so many that I feel like the game is leading me by the hand? Does each clue feel coherent and rational?

It’s interesting trying to answer those questions while thinking about my time with studio Frogwares creation. To be honest, I don’t think any of the responses is a simple one. But let’s start from the beginning, exploring every element and trying to reach a more or less logical conclusion.

Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is the tale of a younger version of the character we often see portrayed. The game shows his first steps in Cordona, an island that invites the player to reveal its extravagant cases, and a chance for Sherlock to remember some harsh events from his childhood. Fortunately, he’s not alone: his friend Jon —not to be confused with his historic sidekick, John H. Watson— will accompany him all the way to the end of the adventure.

Show me your tricks, Mr. Holmes

Solving any main case involves several features. Sherlock can examine objects in a crime scene, interrogate suspects, create portraits or show them evidence, eavesdrop on people chattering about relevant matters, and even elaborate chemical analysis on certain items. You can also wear disguises to access otherwise locked scenarios or talk with specific NPCs that wouldn’t give him the time of day if they knew he was an arrogant high-class fella. However, the most interesting mechanics involve using deduction abilities, such as “Concentrate”, which can reveal important clues while investigating a scene or looking for a specific suspect in the streets. Sherlock can also use “Imagination” to vividly reconstruct how a scene happened, choosing its agents and actions and the order they happened in. Lastly, he’s able to access a menu called “Mind Palace” in which you can connect clues and elaborate thoughts that will gradually create the path to a conclusion when the case is about to be solved.

Most of these actions are performed by pressing or holding a button, looking for an object of interest or selecting the correct evidence/situation when needed. More often than not, playing as a detective is fun: the cases are deeply layered with engaging characters, conflicting interests, multiple crimes, well-thought-out plot twists and rich dialogue. A unique feature that differentiates this title from other detective titles is that you can solve a case by accusing the wrong suspect. This won’t end in a game over. Instead, the main story will continue and you’ll notice a small glimpse of your consequences by purchasing the newspaper. During one of my playthroughs, I was ready to close a case by accusing a man of provoking an elephant to go hostile, which led to the murder of another man. However, I doubted it for a moment. I thought that I could talk with the daughter of the murdered person agian and show her evidence I didn’t share with her before. It actually worked, and it allowed me to finish the case without sending anyone to prison —just protecting the animal.

These are the moments where the game shines the most. At the decisive moments of every major case, I experienced a genuine feeling of uncertainty. I became anxious, reading my notes again, revisiting the evidence, speaking aloud to myself about my first conclusion. After an internal debate, I just moved forward and closed the mystery —always doubting what I have done.

Unfortunately, some of these impressive moments required hours of frustrations, wandering aimlessly around the town, and solving situations that didn’t feel fair at all.

Okay, so… what now?

This island of Cordona consists of different districts that you can visit by travelling on foot or using fast travel locations —once you have unlocked them by visiting them. The main idea behind the game is that you are free to explore Cordona at your own pace, searching for the key elements needed to move forward. For instance, from time to time you’ll need to locate a specific suspect in the street by using a bit of intel or a photo. Sherlock can examine civilians using his “Concentrate” ability and find a distinctive characteristic of the person he is looking for. In theory, he can also ask random NPCs about this person and, with some luck, receive relevant information about their whereabouts.

This doesn’t always work though. Cordona’s streets are usually crawled with many people living their lives and most of them won’t know about what you’re looking for. On one occasion, I asked dozens of NPCs if they knew a certain woman and none of them answered positively. Some of them were even rude, and I spent a considerable amount of time just running around the district until I found a woman, several blocks from my initial location, who pointed me in the right direction. This felt as if I’d advanced in the story merely by chance, breaking all the immersion and hard work put in by delicately presenting every clue until that point.

Sadly, this situation repeated itself a couple of times. During some segments, I needed to go to one of three archives, located in different buildings at the centre of the island, and find more information about a suspect or location. While most of the time I could solve these without issue, on some occasions the intel I had was too vague to realize which archive I should visit. This, again, meant I ended up running in circles, trying multiple options that lead nowhere and wasting valuable time. Even if the game has “difficulty” options for its puzzle-solving, the use of all the hints doesn’t prevent the player from getting stuck every now and then.

It’s important to explain that even if the game presents an open-world and multiple possible endings for each case, that doesn’t mean its structure isn’t linear most of the time. Sherlock usually needs to find the clues and evidence in a specific order, and he can’t progress further if he lacks any essential piece of evidence. Sure, you can find some extra clues that might change your conclusion, but that’s it. There isn’t anything inherently wrong with this approach, however, it’s a double-edged sword when considering some of these problems. Instead of feeling that I was spending my time becoming an ace detective, it sometimes felt more like playing roulette.

Not everything is a crime

Apart from solving the five cases from the main story, Sherlock Holmes and his friend will try to reveal the mystery about the death of Holmes’ mother. After each major case is complete, Sherlock will be allowed to visit his former house and explore a new room, full of memories about his childhood. These segments are incredibly crafted and they present some of the best dialogues between Sherlock and Jon, whose exchanges about life, the past and current events tend to be exquisitely involving.

Cordona is full of side cases that can be found by exploring the different districts, talking to NPCs, picking up posters on walls or recalling moments with Jon. Sometimes, they are simple cases that involve just a bit of exploration. On other occasions, they present surprising complexity. The need to find pieces of evidence, speak with multiple characters and find what’s going on with a lost violin, a ghost story and much more. These secondary missions are a nice excuse to freely explore the island, which also presents markets to buy new outfits for Sherlock, or furniture for his house.

On a different note, one aspect I haven’t touched on until now is combat. While at first it might seem interesting and a good addition to change the flow of the cases, it loses its freshness pretty quickly and becomes a boring gimmick after a few scenes. Sherlock’s fighting abilities include a revolver, limited slow motion when aiming and a special move that can blind enemies for a few seconds when fully charged. The game encourages you to nonfatally deal with the enemy. In order to do that, you have to shoot them in a specific part of their equipment or clothes — sometimes they carry an incendiary item, have a hat, or they’re wearing armour. Parts of the world can also be shot at to create a distraction and before rushing in to start a QTE that will put the enemy down.

The lack of variety in the combat makes it more of a nuisance than a feature. After your first battle against enemies, you have seen everything the game has to offer and it won’t change from there. Fortunately, you can select an option to skip all the combat sections from the beginning, but a well-thought system would have added another layer to the story.

Final Thoughts

It’s hard trying to summarize my experience with Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. On one hand, there are aspects that are brilliant and can fill you with great satisfaction when every piece of the puzzle falls into place. On the other hand, when the immersion is broken by obnoxious or random ways of finding the next clue, you’ll find your enjoyment of each case diminished.

Hopefully, the team at Frogwares can create a more refined tale for Chapter Two. The deeply uncomfortable notes within the game itself as I mentioned in the intro are one thing. However, even when it comes to the gameplay, while there’s certainly a lot of promise here, it never quite feels like it sticks the landing, which is a real shame.",Sherlock Holmes Chapter One Review

3 Mindlessly dull

It’s a rare bird that makes a mark on a largely forgettable genre that’s often associated with camp. And then, there’s Bloodshore. We thought we were free of interactive movies after the 90s/00s, but then Netflix put out Bandersnatch and had people fleetingly enthralled by the idea of a movie that gave you narrative options, as if the choose-your-own-adventure book hasn’t already been a perfectly good play staple for decades.

Wales Interactive, a company built on the brief resurgent wave of full-motion video (FMV) games around the mid-10s, has yet to do anything genuinely interesting with the concept, and yet to put out a truly exciting reinvigoration of the genre. Their repertoire involves, for the most part, stories that aren’t substantially very good, but still require you to make time-sensitive decisions that drag the plot along to a predictable end (will the heroine save ancillary character A or B, what will this mean for the outcome, so on, and so forth).

The basic premise of Bloodshore is Battle Royale/Fortnite/Hunger Games meets overclocked streaming culture—not an especially distant concept based on our current reality where corporations will do anything to get eyeballs, clicks, and money. In recent years, this particularly noxious breed of sensationalism took form as “Game2: Winter”—a Russian wilderness survival show where anything, including rape and murder, was supposedly “fair game.” Thankfully it turned out to be a market research experiment and not a real-life variation of dystopian fiction like The Running Man and most recently, Squid Game.

The corporate antagonist in Bloodshore is also Russian and runs the popular game series Kill/Stream, where “Z-list” personalities are dumped on an island and forced to kill their way to victory. We learn that the show’s debut season had a specific gimmick: the contestants were notorious death row inmates who fought for their freedom and went on to become famous and mind-bogglingly wealthy. But after Kill/Stream’s original creator, the enigmatic Eugene Christoph, stepped down, the show has devolved into a seasonal slopfest. Now, in the 13th season, they’re trying to claw back viewers with a change of scenery and new rules.

Not that Wanted

The real heroes of Bloodshore are its cast, a group of working actors that really makes the best of what they’re given. Protagonist Nick Romeo is an ex-child actor looking to redeem himself on Kill/Stream for his own reasons. The rest of his “drop group” is made up of awkward familiar stereotypes: Scarlett is the vapid, naive Instagrammer who isn’t remotely prepared for reality, Reah is a tough, confident MMA fighter, Otto is a cocky streamer whose fans are probably Gamergaters. There’s eye candy Gav (played by Glee alum and ex-boybander Max George), and Dev, a suspected cannibal who answers a very important aesthetic question: what if Julian Assange had grown up in Village of the Damned?

Altogether, this could have made for a passable bad movie that touches on important topics like the voracious nature of internet culture, the role of personal agency and individual choice in media consumption, streaming labor and exploitation, and other meta-issues that permeate our world. But Bloodshore chooses to be a mostly mindless experience where the choices you’re given don’t feel substantial or meaningful, which is literally all you can do for a player in this format. Even when you’re choosing whose life to save or to spare a comrade unnecessary torture, Nick’s reason for being on Kill/Stream is already pushed out in the open—it’s all already rigged, what does it matter?

Stuck in the 90s

There’s an especially hammy clip of a TV interviewer screaming at Eugene Christoph about how he can sit by and let his Kill/Stream erode our minds and bodies even further—that with every season of Kill/Stream, we stray further from god’s light, which isn’t wrong. But we don’t need these reminders or “how can you just sit there” rhetoric anymore—this isn’t the 1980s or 1990s or even 00s when there was still a kind of weird, raw excitement about web 2.0 and “social media” as a new part of everyday life. It’s 2021 and we’re all living in the same toxic mediascape that makes a fictional idea like Bloodshore possible.

Bloodshore’s whole vibe was exciting when I was a teenager and we had no mass lived experience of how technology was going to kick us back into Roman Colosseum-era levels of spectacle and complacency. There’s no sense of catharsis even when you get the “good ending” because the movie wasn’t engaging or well-written enough to at least give me the illusion of escape in the first place. When the characters yell and beat their chests about exploitation, there’s nothing behind it; Bloodshore is a poor, dull parody of its own message.

On the interactive front, there is no clear indication of save points. You’re forced to make an educated guess as to when you can stop playing, and end up having to replay a big chunk of D-movie quality content anyway. Even if it isn’t long to play, if you work in media and already have a decrepit soul hanging on by a thread, you will probably need a break. If you’re interested in hate-playing Bloodshore, it’s not even fun enough to do that with the requisite level of zest. The generic tracking options, as with other Wales Interactive productions, don’t make any sense. Romance with Tish, for instance, somehow goes up even though I turned her down and kept my distance from her at all possible points.

Decent production value and acting are all this has going for it. Even so, Bloodshore is one of many projects that don’t ever have to be interactive, and unfortunately, it won’t be the last of its kind.",The Indie Game Website

8 Comforting and clever

Moving is awful. Even when the circumstances are good—a new job, a new city, a new relationship—the process of condensing one’s life into a series of boxes, moving them, and fitting all those things into a new space is not what many of us would consider at all pleasant. Witch Beam Games, then, deserves a tremendous amount of credit for building a game centred entirely on the third of those steps that is clever, attractive, and engaging. Unpacking, a meditative puzzle game, tasks the player with pulling objects out of boxes and arranging them in a sensible manner in the new living space that the unseen main character is intending to occupy.

Each of these new spaces lines up with an event in the main character’s life—a new school, a new relationship, a new job—and much of the pleasure of playing Unpacking comes from the irresistible impulse to play the busybody. One might, for example, take interest in which childhood knick-knacks the main character brings to college and which she leaves at home. After devoting a tremendous amount of care to setting up the perfect workspace for her artistic pursuits, one may be a bit concerned that the new apartment (and the man who apparently lives there) seems to think that setting up a laptop and drawing tablet on the kitchen’s sole sitting area will be sufficient accommodation. While I don’t want to spoil the reader’s opportunity to play voyeur/detective on their own, the nature of the relocation that comes after this attempt at cohabitation is a bit heartbreaking even if it isn’t much of a surprise.

But, importantly, it isn’t the end, either. One’s path through life is not exactly a linear thing, and having to take a step back can be an opportunity to revisit, rediscover, and reinvent one’s self. (Or at least—spoiler—it is for Unpacking’s unseen main character.)

If Unpacking is something of a peanut butter sandwich of a game—that is, genuinely enjoyable comfort food rather than haute cuisine—it should still be recognised as good peanut butter on good bread. Telling a story in objects is a substantial accomplishment, and if Unpacking doesn’t quite reach the quirky, peculiar height of Gone Home or What Remains of Edith Finch, it still succeeds in being both particular and relatable. After arranging her objects seven or eight times (and dealing with her implied feedback when everything is unpacked but not quite yet in the “right” place), I feel like I have a sense of what the unnamed main character has been through. I know at least something about what she values, and what she has accomplished. I’m not entirely sure whether every single object is a souvenir of a dream accomplished or reflects an aspiration not yet realised, but I know at least that her degree now hangs proudly on the wall instead of having to be tucked away in someone else’s closet.

Third-person exploration

There’s a digression necessary here. I mentioned Gone Home and What Remains of Edith Finch and then just kept going, but while Unpacking falls into the same “story discovered by spending time in someone else’s domestic space” genre as those two games, there’s a fundamental difference. In both Gone Home and What Remains of Edith Finch, the player inhabits the role of a person whose condition mirrors the player’s inherent alienation from the space and objects being explored. Katie in Gone Home is returning after an absence to reconstruct her sister Samantha’s story, and Edith in What Remains of Edith Finch breaks into a house full of sealed rooms to uncover generations of tragedy in her family.

Unpacking, on the other hand, seems to want to encourage the player to identify with the unseen main character, which of course, is incompatible with a story that emerges through objects. While there’s always a bit of discovery in unpacking even a box one has packed one’s self—as I know all too well—every object is the result of events that the narrator already knows about, or choices she has already made. The player in effect plays the role of a domestic servant, intimately aware of a person’s objects and circumstances over time, but not reflected in them, and left to construct an understanding of someone else’s inner being over time. To my awareness, only Tale of Tales’ game Sunset has really played explicitly with this framing of a domestic employee in this genre.

This of course, isn’t really intended as a criticism of Unpacking. It’s just an incongruity. And incongruities can be really interesting.

Seeing yourself in objects

So where was I? Moving, in real life, is bad, or at least unpleasant. Unpacking, the game, is good, or at least very enjoyable. We carry ourselves in objects. They remain, even when we do not. We make them fit, even when we do not. I hate unpacking. I liked Unpacking very much. It’s complicated, but it’s as simple as a peanut butter sandwich, toasted in the sandwich press that you got three apartments ago.",The Indie Game Website

6 stylish but indistinct

Who doesn’t love a brawler? It is the spaghetti and meatballs of video games. It is tasty. It is filling. There’s little mystery to it. An auto-pilot meal when a day has you beat. But swap out too many of the key ingredients—the noodles, the sauce, the meatballs—and you’ll eventually find yourself talking about another pasta dish entirely. None of those permutative dishes will satiate the hunger you may have for spaghetti and meatballs, but you probably wouldn’t want, as Kirk Van Houten argued at a PTA meeting, two spaghetti meals in one day.

These beat ‘em up brawlers happen to be having a moment. River City Ransom, Streets of Rage, Battletoads, even the vaporware Scott Pilgrim game are all making comebacks. There’s a charming looking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle just around the corner. It’s more of a resurgence than a renaissance; the existence of games like Devil May Cry, Yakuza, Treachery in Beatdown City and Friends of Ringo Ishikawa are evidence that the genre’s renaissance already happened.

Tunche is a new brawler moulded by Peruvean folklore. It follows four young heroes (plus the Hat Kid from Hat in Time) each looking to confront the titular forest spirit for their own rites. While always an intimidating creature, Tunche’s terror in the Amazon has seemingly escalated, with other beasts imbued with fearsome powers and ripping a path of destruction.

Green Pastures

Tunche was successfully kickstarted back in 2019, and it’s not hard to see what drew fans to the project. Lush, colorful and tied together with vibrant character animations, Tunche’s picture book sensibilities are a nice treat. The monsters pestering the deep Amazon have some imaginative critters among them. I am especially fond of the scorpion hiding in a log like a hermit crab. The developers also promised a game that fuses beat-em-ups with roguelike elements: two genres that have often proved malleable.

There’s a bit to untangle in your first run. At least four separate types of stat points accumulate while bopping mean frogs and bad birds. From traditional coins and XP to more ethereal magics and orbs that can be spent on certain upgrades when starting back at camp, some resources are shared between characters, including couch co-op friends, while others are fixed. For example, you can chance-encounter ‘Cores’ during each run. Cores function similarly to Hades’ boons, except in Tunche you can permanently level up your favorites before heading out. Those boosts will apply to each hero across the board, though it never guarantees that anyone’ll stumble upon them on a run.

River Basin Ransom



Each of the five characters begin with three very standard, nearly identical attacks: a melee, a projectile and a launching uppercut. Their more distinctive combos and attacks require some grinding to unlock. Even basic abilities, like ground pounds and mid-air recoveries, have to be paid for in each character—which is where Tunche begins to feel short of what’s grand between its influences.

Rewards in Tunche are more generous if you maintain a high ‘style’ rating in each encounter. You achieve greater style by using more varieties of attacks and avoid getting dinged. These rewards can be very useful in unlocking new combos, but you may already start to sniff out what’s stubborn about this system. Starting with only three attacks, you will likely rely on repeating the same three-strike air and ground combos. That’ll generally hover you at a B rating. Even the Cores are means tested. Cores that can add lightning and poison effects to each attack only have a chance of working if your Style is above an A. That condition never changes even if you invest in levelling Cores up.

This peculiar system pays off if you’d like to preemptively buff up each character for when a friend comes over, but not if your chum wants to play with you from the get-go. Having to reach a later point where the combat makes itself more interesting doesn’t make for a compelling adventure. Enemies do considerably more damage as each level progresses (the dang fish can chomp off a fifth of your health). It makes sense as a way to close the gameplay loop and encourage you to master the earlier worlds, but worlds do not offer much more upon repeat visits. Set pieces, the greatest attraction brawlers have in their corner, do not exist in Tunche. Bosses, grotesque monster versions of otherwise cuddly snuggly animals, are Tunche at its best, but do not mix things up for rematches.

Style takes precedence

Games like Streets of Rage and Turtles in Time made themselves classics with audacious spectacles, making up for their inevitable elevator stages. Games like Enter the Gungeon, Hades and Binding of Isaac sweeten each run with distinct combat that swirls itself up on each visit, driving players to discover their favorite loadouts or enjoying the compromises when luck proves rotten.

Tunche does not do either of these things. Each stage is a field without so much as a hill. Alterations to combat are basically bottlenecked in the homebase, while randomised Cores do not really make much of a difference in how you scrap.

Little changes between each playthrough of Tunche, and not a whole lot happens during them. Tunche best serves fans and friends of dishing knuckle sandwiches together, but doesn’t synchronise its genre mashups in a way that elevates it above the many RPG-tinted beat ‘em ups stomping around out there.",The Indie Game Website

9 A brilliant sequel

Darkest Dungeon 2 is an incredibly smart sequel. Instead of just giving us more Darkest Dungeon, which would have been more than adequate given the original’s quality, Red Hook has taken its eldritch horrors and gloomy gothic aesthetic and injected that into a more structured roguelike system. Though this does mean we lose some of the systems that are now a trademark of Darkest Dungeon, the move toward a more focused experience mostly succeeds in cutting some fat from the original title and making Darkest Dungeon 2 an absolute thrill.

In Darkest Dungeon 2, you are tasked with taking the last flame of hope through a series of increasingly grizzly paths up toward a mountain top, where a great evil needs to be slain. As Darkest Dungeon 2 is currently in Early Access, the only “confession” available is “denial” (the themes of each playthrough seem to be focused around the five stages of grief).

The differences between the original title and its sequel become apparent early on when you are tasked with choosing your party. Unlike the first game, where you had a whole host of different adventurers who would form a larger party, each attempt in Darkest Dungeon 2 lets you pick a completely new and fresh set of adventurers based on their class. This does have the adverse effect of seeing the tortured souls you are taking on this carriage journey from hell as yet another nameless henchman; after all, they will most likely die. It’s a roguelike after all; dying is the whole thing.

But it does also mean that, when the turn-based combat sequences kick in, you are encouraged to try inventive and braver combat manoeuvres. There’s no leaving poor Derek the Highwayman at the base to recover.

No point in friendships

Speaking of home-base, there isn’t one. All the people management mechanics of the original have been removed to facilitate the move toward a roguelike format. That, in many ways, is a shame. There isn’t another game quite like Darkest Dungeon for its blend of exploration, combat and asset management, especially within its delightfully grotesque gothic horror setting. But the move to a roguelike system has allowed Red Hook to focus on making combat, stress and item management alongside party dynamics more fluid and effective within the confines of time-limits and increasingly difficult enemy encounters. By and large, these systems all work exceptionally, and at no point did I feel like I didn’t have a grasp on what items I had, or how to effectively use them.

The party management aspect definitely needs some tweaking, however. Getting stressed out and adversarial toward your comrades is far more likely than nurturing friendships for your crew, however, which is an issue when just moving through the world can rack up the blood pressure for some adventurers. When adversarial, your party will purposely harm allies, from de-buffing to outright blocking healing attempts. This would be fine if the benefits to maxing out a friendship offered an equivalent buff, but this just isn’t the case. Because of this, the stress system adds an artificial difficulty to the game. As Darkest Dungeon 2 is currently in Early Access, these are the types of issues one may be resolved in the future.

New combat

The combat is where Darkest Dungeon 2 truly shines. The game has kept the core fundamentals of what made the first game so fun. Dramatic zoom shots on hits, alongside exquisite narration that describes the action and surprisingly deep and satisfying tactical nuance. Having a party that conforms to a more role-based format gives encounters a much-needed balance. In the first game, I often found myself choosing un-balanced parties as other members stayed back at the inn to lower their stress levels–or died–but that’s not an issue here. This allowed me to take the time to find combos that would buff my party and de-buff enemies efficiently.

The roguelike genre requires players to master the combat to ensure victory, and applying this to turn-based combat has resulted in the balance of clever tactics and electrifying Hail Mary plays. Unlike the original, failure in Darkest Dungeon 2 doesn’t translate to starting over at the beginning of the dungeon with zero resources and untrained henchmen, but instead just sets you back at the start. It’s a learning experience that will make the next run easier.

Darkest Dungeon 2, even in its Early Access state, is a marvellous roguelike that offers players a whole host of avenues with which to approach the game’s numerous encounters. There are definitely issues surrounding difficulty, as well as the occasionally dropped text line or repetitive dialogues that anyone playing a game in Early Access would expect. Though Darkest Dungeon 2 may take players to dark and horrible places, it is a glowing example of how new systems can be effectively applied to a well-established setting and aesthetic.",Darkest Dungeon 2 (Early Access) Review

6 Very promising

Have you ever tried really hard to like something? Maybe it’s a specific food everyone else goes crazy over; perhaps it’s a song constantly played on the radio, or maybe it’s a game that you’ve been excited about for so long that you now feel obligated to enjoy? Well, I have, and that game is Moonglow Bay.

That said, here’s something I never thought I’d be writing: I quite enjoyed my time in Moonglow Bay; some might even go as far as to say I’m hooked on it. If you’d spoken to me a few days ago, however, my opinion on Moonglow Bay wouldn’t have been even close to as positive.

There’s no use sugar-coating it: when I jumped into Moonglow Bay on launch, I did not enjoy a single second of my time in it, even though it’s a game that, by every measure, should have been right up my alley. I’m also not alone in that opinion. A quick browse through Steam’s reviews will show dozens of players, echoing the same feelings of disappointment and frustration with the game. My personal favourite review is just one word: “No.”

Might be worth playing

One of the first opinions I jotted down when playing Moonglow Bay was that even if the developers sorted out all the glitches, bugs and issues, I still wasn’t convinced that the game would be worth playing, and that was because there was barely a game beneath these bugs; it largely felt empty and pointless. I was sure you would be better off casting your line elsewhere. However, starting up the game again post-patch, I could finally see the gem of a game that was there all the time.

The story behind Moonglow Bay is a sentimental and novel one. You play as someone who moved with their partner to a little fishing town, only to have your partner disappear under mysterious circumstances. The village of Moonglow Bay always had a superstitious fear of the waters surrounding it, and your partner’s disappearance only spurred this on. Fast forward to a few years later, and you are now a middle-aged individual drowning in your heartbreak and fast food packaging. But while you’ve spent the last three years falling apart at home, Moonglow Bay has been breaking at the seams too. A surprise visit from your daughter convinced you to start living your life again–and give Moonglow bay a second chance at survival as well.

Still cosy and relaxing

At its core, Moonglow Bay is a relaxing and cosy game about love, dealing with loss and finding yourself, regardless of age. Starting Moonglow Bay is a speedy and straightforward experience; you are given three pre-made characters to choose from, you then get to pick your name and your pronoun. You then select your partner out of a choice of three and their preferred pronoun, and that’s it; you’re ready to go. And throughout the game, you will spend your days fishing, and your nights cooking. The money you make selling your fellow villager’s favourite meals to them will be spent on improving the town around you.

Moonglow Bay is simple, from its Voxel art style to its combat free playstyle, and yet simple never equates to empty or dull. Whether it’s petting your dog (adorably named Waffles), talking to the other residents, taking a new type of fish you caught to the aquarium or cooking up a meal for the lovely old lady down the street; there is always something for you to do, although there is never a sense of urgency to any of it – which could very easily be a pro or a con, depending on what experience you’re looking for.

Life after patching

I will say that my game experience drastically improved after the controller support got fixed. Yes, you can play Moonglow Bay with a keyboard, but you shouldn’t if you can help it. The whole experience is just so much more relaxing when you can curl up with pillows and blankets and just get lost in the music while playing instead of having to sit right by your keyboard and perform constant finger gymnastics–but that’s just me.

Starting up the game again post-patch, I could finally see the gem of a game that was there all the time. Moonglow Bay still has a long way to go; the movement still feels overly clunky, the fishing is severely lacking, considering that it’s the selling point of the game, and the camera is at times so bad I feel like I’m back in the 90s again.

However, looking at the progress the game has made in just a week fills me with hope that before long Moonglow Bay is going to reflect the labor of love that it clearly is. Even though I don’t see myself swapping out my go-to “rainy day” games like Stardew Valley or Moonlighter for Moonglow Bay anytime soon, I’m also not ready to say that I definitely won’t. The amount of progress that the game made in just a week and a single patch has given me nothing but hope for its future, and it’s a game I’ll be keeping an eye on in the weeks to come.

Moonglow Bay also supports local coop, and while I’ll always support anything that allows me to play with friends, the game feels like an almost personal experience that I didn’t ever feel the urge to invite someone to share with me. So with that, I’ll leave you with my closing thoughts of Moonglow Bay: Not bad, cod be better.",Moonglow Bay Review

6.5 A slow journey

I have a complicated relationship with MMOs that’s steadily evolved over the years. I suck at them. Not through lack of skill or experience, at least in this particular context, rather that I can never play them properly. Despite having the opportunity—and of course being heavily encouraged—to play and go questing with countless players from all over the world, ultimately I end up wandering off on my own into the wilds, and it becomes another solo RPG adventure.

So when a game comes along that pitches an adventure truly of your choosing and meeting other players as rare and fleeting should you wish it, it will naturally elicit my best meerkat impression.

Coining the term ‘TMO’ or ‘Tiny Multiplayer Online’, Book of Travels by Swedish studio Might and Delight entered Early Access in October 2021 and puts you into the role of a wanderer in the vast, majestic landscape of the Braided Shore. Your beginnings, your journey, what you learn and delve into along the way: all of this is to be decided by the choices you make. Whether you choose to become versed in the properties of plants, be a danger seeker or simply follow the winds and keep walking, your story is just that: yours. Yours for the shaping.

Choosing forms

When creating a character, rather than choosing a race or class, you have a selection of ‘forms’ to choose from. These each have a couple of starting skills and serve more as a foundation for you to imprint your own ideas and personality onto. Choosing your upbringing will give you a brief sentence describing it. Take the Mystical for example: “Your child spirit was open to the mysteries. You spent your youth learning to control your mystic gifts”. What this means for your character, if anything at all, is unclear. Are my spells more effective? Do I learn them more quickly? Or is it simply a descriptor? So many questions already.

Once you’ve moulded a form to your satisfaction, you set out into the world. And in the words of a certain Mr Armstrong’s “What a Wonderful World”, and inspired by Eastern art and aesthetics, the delicate watercolour landscape of the Braided Shore is truly unique and captivating. Instantly you feel as though you’ve stepped into the threads of an ancient tapestry.

Making conversations

Might and Delight are very up front about how Book of Travels is for wayfinders, and that it won’t plan your route. After a brief tutorial covering some of the game’s elements, you are literally set adrift: pick a direction, head out and see what you discover. Players who are well versed in the realms of tabletop RPGs will feel very much at home. There’s a similar vibe to the story-centric tabletop game Tales of the Arabian Nights about it, minus the quest markers. Depending on the locations you investigate, the events you stumble on or the NPCs you talk to, your character will gain experience and snippets of lore that may or may not be useful in your travels. But again, the extent of this is completely unknown. And speaking of the coined term ‘Tiny Multiplayer Online’? It’s not hyperbole. Each server is limited to seven or eight players each and meeting them is indeed rare. But should you meet a fellow wanderer, there are ‘encounters’ which require co-operation in order to complete.

The communication mechanic is also one of the more interesting elements. Instead of a chat box, you have a selection of icons representing different words or emotions that grows the more you discover. A clever reflection of two people of different languages trying to converse through sporadically learned words or gestures.

Slow-paced journey

Perhaps it’s a given for some, but one aspect of the Book of Travels experience cannot be stressed enough: this game is a slow burner. Intensely so. That’s not necessarily a bad thing and as mentioned earlier, Might and Delight are very up front about how much of a departure the game is from what you’d expect. But even the disclaimer doesn’t quite prepare you for the considerably slower pace of the game, and many may get caught off guard by it. For some, this can be a counterpoint to the over-the-top grindy atmosphere of traditional MMOs, which will be a breath of fresh air. For others, this will be an energy-sapper. As for myself, I drifted back and forth in between, but slightly more towards the latter than I’d hoped.

Being in Early Access, bugs are of course fairly prevalent and content is a little on the thin side. With nothing to help influence your decisions, it’s easy to find yourself doing very little. Having an affinity for the mystical and being a good Brit, I’d decided to strive to become a savant of Knots (the equivalent of spells) and brew a colossal amount of different tasty teas. But after hours of gameplay, I had barely come across any NPCs nor done much more than picking flowers in a seemingly endless field. And perhaps my skills are indeed wanting after all, but I couldn’t figure out how to brew tea for the life of me. As a Brit (and a Northerner to boot), oh the shame!

Ultimately, Book of Travels is indeed an experience unlike any other, and despite its flaws, it has numerous intriguing elements and a great deal of potential. If your imagination and inspiration is boundless, then you will find a wealth of adventure and enjoyment. If you need a game that offers direction and structure, turn back traveller. Your adventure lies elsewhere.",Book of Travels (Early Access) Review
