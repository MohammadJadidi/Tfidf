7 A mixed bag

The end of the world is a familiar thing in Surviving the Aftermath. I don’t mean that in a philosophical sense, although the exploitation of resources, warmongering, and frequent disasters have clear parallels with modern society. I mean what Surviving the Aftermath has me doing to contend with these disasters is something I’ve seen before, many times. Paradox’s survival management sim has the potential to be something special, but never builds on that to set itself apart from other, more unique games in the genre.

Your journey into the polluted wilderness starts with a set of choices. Surviving the Aftermath asks you to tailor the difficulty as you see fit, and while the available options are extensive, there’s not much context to help you know what you’re actually doing. Is 75% difficulty with a moderate chance of natural disasters and easy to please civilians a good formula? You probably won’t know in your first game, though admittedly, it’s difficult to figure out even in your second game and beyond. More extensive options or descriptions, or maybe even just preset game modes, would make this step much easier.

Happy survivors happy something that rhymes with survivors

Either way, it turns out my wish for happy survivors was a good thing. They woke up grumpy every day thanks to a lack of hygiene facilities and a dearth of drinkable water, but it had minimal effect on the settlement’s overall satisfaction. A happy side effect of confusing difficulty options or not, I appreciated the flexibility. Surviving the Aftermath adopts a minimalist approach to its tutorials that often meant I was scrambling to figure out what it expected from me

After that, it’s time to meet your specialists. Surviving the Aftermath gives you nearly a dozen unique characters with interesting backstories, and they’re the heroes of your settlement with special abilities to help in certain areas, such as fighting or scouting. I picked a scout and warrior the first time, though not because I was particularly keen on their perks. The specialist selection screen also has little context to help with your first game or two. Their identities and goals are what intrigued me.

One character lost their partner in the great catastrophe and was searching for a new life. Another wanted to help heal the physical and emotional wounds of others and work toward a brighter future.

We can be better

That’s what intrigued me about Surviving the Aftermath. No matter their background, the point was building something better and sustainable — and maybe roughing up a few dozen clans who thought differently, but that’s beside the point. There’s a special feeling of productivity and cleanness from taking raw waste such as plastic and turning it into water storage or watching people band together to create literal and metaphorical light in the dark wilderness.

You’ll have plenty of other resources, of course, and the moment-to-moment loop is familiar for anyone who’s played a management sim before — perhaps a bit too familiar. Once you’ve progressed and built a gate, your settlement can expand across the world map, encountering new dangers, people, and resources. Then it settles into the usual loop of maintaining progress, balancing expansion with conserving resources, and recovering from unexpected calamities.

A little empty

The trouble is that’s all there is. Paradox doesn’t do much else with the setting or themes. It feels as if Surviving the Aftermath is still in early access to an extent, like Paradox wanted to do more and just hasn’t yet. Aside from the specialists’ lack of importance or personality, this sense of something missing is most prominent in the mini-events that pop up occasionally.

These ask you to make a choice of some kind, though the right choice is painfully obvious in almost every case, with no consequences for making it. It’s in everyone’s best interests if you save the citizens who fell into a sinkhole, for example. I’d hoped for more interesting development with the specialists or at least some choices that had a visible effect on how a game unfolded.

Nip to the loo

The same is true for Surviving the Aftermath’s other significant features, such as upgrading facilities. It’s smart, efficient, and expected. You enhance your toilets because you need better hygiene, but upgrades add nothing unique to the experience and don’t change how you approach a round. It’s just checking off another box on the list of things you do in a management sim.

What you’re left with is a decent game, and that’s disappointing because it could have been more. For some reason, Paradox played it safe and didn’t build on its own and the game’s strengths. If you want a different take on the genre, it’s worth picking up on sale, but there are better and more interesting examples to spend your time and money on.",Surviving the Aftermath Review

6 A little flawed

Over the past year, Warpzone Studios has toiled away on updates for its Dwarven mining and colony sim Hammerting. Now the game has emerged from the Early Access caverns as the ornately crafted finished product. Well, supposedly anyway. After spelunking in the game for a while, I can’t help but feel like Hammerting needed a little more time in the forge.

It’s an intriguing premise. You take charge of a dwarven mining colony and begin plundering a massive cavern for valuable resources to craft into weapons, armour, and other tools to aid in a war that rages above ground. It’s not often that games let you be the unsung heroes in a conflict, and I was intrigued to see where the story might go. But sadly, it’s entirely surface level and merely serves as a brief explanation for your mining efforts.

But once you get into the swing of things, the lack of narrative is unlikely to be all that bothersome. You just have to reach that stage first. The game’s tutorial isn’t fantastic, dropping you into the mountain with a few pop-up boxes with reams of text and wishing you the best of luck without providing any real direction. For veterans of the genre, it’s unlikely to be a problem, but if you’re a newcomer enticed by the prospect of commanding a team of dwarven miners, it’s a rough start that will turn a few frustrated people away.

But if you stick around and push past that barrier, Hammerting houses a tonne of depth that micro-managers and lovers of creating efficient worlds will adore. The more you explore and trade with the settlements above ground, the more research tokens you will earn to unlock additional buildings and transport to improve your mining operation and see it flourish. At the start, you’ll have to watch your dwarves stroll from place to place and create rickety ladders for them to access harder to reach spots. But eventually, you can build elevators to make this more convenient and create a whole minecart railway system to transport resources quicker and easier. There’s a lot of satisfaction to be found in creating a smooth workflow.

Cosy dwellings

It looks lovely as well, thanks to the smart use of lighting. Unexplored areas are grey and foggy, with a hint of mystery and danger surrounding them, while any buildings you’ve created emit the warm glow of a cosy fire, making them truly feel like home. After making good progress, it’s enjoyable to zoom out and see how far your underground city has developed and, likewise, how much more of the underground cave system is still waiting to be explored, providing a wonderful sense of scale.

But that’s a best-case scenario. Sometimes, reaching the point where your colony is thriving is marred by several minor but irritating issues that detract from the experience. One of those problems is the dwarves themselves. Seemingly at random, their AI acts in a whole manner of bizarre ways. In Hammerting, rather than directly controlling your dwarves, you give them tasks—whether that’s mining, crafting, or battling intruders— and they’ll go about their business, in theory.

Oftentimes, they will frequently rush over to the place you’ve told them to mine or craft, do so for a few seconds and simply stop, locked in an eternal staring contest with the rock in front of them. On other occasions, they will run back and forth like they’re on fire for seemingly no reason, unable to find a path to their destination, even if they’ve been to the exact same spot before without a problem.

There are a few aspects of the game that feel fairly pointless, such as the dwarves’ individual stats. They each bring different attributes and skills to the game, but they don’t seem to matter all that much. Any dwarf is perfectly capable of completing each task, and because they’re not particularly distinct to look at, you probably won’t know who’s who anyway. When I learned that they could permanently die, I thought I would end up in an Xcom style scenario where their demise would crush my soul. Instead, I just recruited a new dwarf and moved on, which is sad. I want to care about the individuals in my colony.

Miner issues

Hammerting also has combat, though it’s not much to write home about. Now and then, your buildings will be attacked by various creatures like slimes and rats. So, you’ll need to send your dwarves over to deal with them. There are no real tactics required for this. The participants will simply stand and trade with each other until one of them perishes. The only real danger with combat is not noticing that a rat is smashing buildings to pieces because the game does a poor job of telling you they’re under attack.

A message appears in the top right-hand corner of the screen to let you know a building is damaged, but you’re more likely to be looking elsewhere, expanding your colony to help it achieve greatness. A notable change in music when a threat had arrived would be a welcome addition, particularly since the ambient soundtrack is fairly anonymous, and I quickly found myself reaching for a podcast or some other music.

Back above ground, things are fairly tedious. You can trade with settlements and provide them with materials to bolster their defences, but it’s really just a series of menus. They can give you missions, but this usually involves creating certain objects for them, and after a while, it feels like you’ve seen them all, and repetition promptly sets in.

There is plenty of fun to be had with Hammerting. The aesthetic is delightful, and when everything works as intended, time joyfully slips away. However, the aforementioned issues frequently rear their ugly heads and immediately halt the enjoyment as you’re forced to try and work around it. Despite the full release status, it still feels like Hammerting is in Early Access since it lacks the polish of some of its peers.",The Indie Game Website

4

Beginning as a project from students at the NYU Center for Games, Moncage (a portmanteau of montage and cage) has existed in one form or another since 2018. And after garnering plenty of awards and honourable mentions at places like PAX and IGF, the adventure-puzzler has finally been released in full on PC.

The world of Moncage is comprised of a montage of photographs, each of which is visible within a single side of a cube-shaped cage. The images are snapshots of significant moments in one person’s life, but for some unknown reason, they never contain any actual people.

Potential energy

Moncage’s puzzles come from adjusting your perspective so that components in two or more of the images align, at which point they interact and affect their surroundings. Sometimes the effects are limited to the images in question; other times, they affect the entire cube, and occasionally they open a door to an entirely new image. Maybe the counterweight of a set of scales on a desk will raise the arm of a crane in a construction zone, or maybe opening a hatch in the floor of a lighthouse will carry a truck across a ravine. Chaining one puzzle after another results in something resembling a Rube-Goldberg machine that spans a lifetime, with you as the catalyst.

Unfortunately, these puzzles can sometimes be frustratingly fiddly. Several times I offered an answer I was sure was correct, to no effect. Then, after spending too long trying other solutions, I would check the game’s hints only to find I was right all along, but hadn’t aligned the images precisely enough to proceed.

More damning though, is that the whole system isn’t satisfying in the way a puzzle should be. The process of solving each one almost always comes down to searching the images for two similar-looking objects, and then lining them up. Every once in a whil, the effects of a solution are delightful, touching, or surprising enough to compensate for the straightforward puzzles. (Flipping through a calendar in one image to change the weather in another is a particular highlight). But these moments are the exceptions, and they’re too few and far between.

Flattened boxes

Maybe it’s unfair to compare Moncage to one of my favourite games of the year, but while playing I couldn’t help being reminded of another game that tells its wordless story through a relatively simple puzzle mechanic, the exceptional Unpacking. But where Unpacking uses everyday objects to render its cast in intimate detail, Moncage’s snapshots lack the kind of specificity required to understand its characters as anything other than broad archetypes.

You know the main character of Moncage is enlisted as a soldier because there are grenades, helmets, and a shooting range outside a large tent. You know they’ve been severely wounded because season after season passes in a hospital room. You even know they’ve been traumatised (if that wasn’t already obvious), because the world the war has wrought looks alien to them from their seat at the bar. But these aren’t insights that help you understand them as a living person. These are passing glances–made hastily and over a long distance–at a stranger.

Only shallow

On its surface, Moncage does so many things I like. Its narrative is conveyed through interaction, rather than through text or cutscenes. Its predominant mechanic is clever. It’s short. But it stands as an example of just how easily a game can be undone by only one or two critical shortcomings. There’s a world in which a few chewy brain teasers would be enough for me to overlook some one-dimensional characters–this is a puzzle game after all. One-dimensional puzzles, though, are harder to forgive.",The Indie Game Website

7 Promising but perplexing

Before I get into the main review, I want to address the content warning Frogwares has put before you get into the game. It warns of outdated views that portray the harsh reality and mistreatment of minorities in cultures back then. It states they’re wrong, which is good, but these portrayals are still in the game. I’m not sure how I feel about this overall. On the one hand, I’m glad the warning is there, but on the other hand, the game features racism, transphobia, and classism, and I’m not certain any of this helps the story to shine.

With that out of the way, creating an ambitious detective adventure must be difficult. There are a couple of essential questions that need to be addressed and reflected on while creating each part of the mystery. For starters, are the puzzles too simple, too hard or just right? How much freedom do I have in my actions? Are there enough hints, so that I know where to go, but not so many that I feel like the game is leading me by the hand? Does each clue feel coherent and rational?

It’s interesting trying to answer those questions while thinking about my time with studio Frogwares creation. To be honest, I don’t think any of the responses is a simple one. But let’s start from the beginning, exploring every element and trying to reach a more or less logical conclusion.

Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is the tale of a younger version of the character we often see portrayed. The game shows his first steps in Cordona, an island that invites the player to reveal its extravagant cases, and a chance for Sherlock to remember some harsh events from his childhood. Fortunately, he’s not alone: his friend Jon —not to be confused with his historic sidekick, John H. Watson— will accompany him all the way to the end of the adventure.

Show me your tricks, Mr. Holmes

Solving any main case involves several features. Sherlock can examine objects in a crime scene, interrogate suspects, create portraits or show them evidence, eavesdrop on people chattering about relevant matters, and even elaborate chemical analysis on certain items. You can also wear disguises to access otherwise locked scenarios or talk with specific NPCs that wouldn’t give him the time of day if they knew he was an arrogant high-class fella. However, the most interesting mechanics involve using deduction abilities, such as “Concentrate”, which can reveal important clues while investigating a scene or looking for a specific suspect in the streets. Sherlock can also use “Imagination” to vividly reconstruct how a scene happened, choosing its agents and actions and the order they happened in. Lastly, he’s able to access a menu called “Mind Palace” in which you can connect clues and elaborate thoughts that will gradually create the path to a conclusion when the case is about to be solved.

Most of these actions are performed by pressing or holding a button, looking for an object of interest or selecting the correct evidence/situation when needed. More often than not, playing as a detective is fun: the cases are deeply layered with engaging characters, conflicting interests, multiple crimes, well-thought-out plot twists and rich dialogue. A unique feature that differentiates this title from other detective titles is that you can solve a case by accusing the wrong suspect. This won’t end in a game over. Instead, the main story will continue and you’ll notice a small glimpse of your consequences by purchasing the newspaper. During one of my playthroughs, I was ready to close a case by accusing a man of provoking an elephant to go hostile, which led to the murder of another man. However, I doubted it for a moment. I thought that I could talk with the daughter of the murdered person agian and show her evidence I didn’t share with her before. It actually worked, and it allowed me to finish the case without sending anyone to prison —just protecting the animal.

These are the moments where the game shines the most. At the decisive moments of every major case, I experienced a genuine feeling of uncertainty. I became anxious, reading my notes again, revisiting the evidence, speaking aloud to myself about my first conclusion. After an internal debate, I just moved forward and closed the mystery —always doubting what I have done.

Unfortunately, some of these impressive moments required hours of frustrations, wandering aimlessly around the town, and solving situations that didn’t feel fair at all.

Okay, so… what now?

This island of Cordona consists of different districts that you can visit by travelling on foot or using fast travel locations —once you have unlocked them by visiting them. The main idea behind the game is that you are free to explore Cordona at your own pace, searching for the key elements needed to move forward. For instance, from time to time you’ll need to locate a specific suspect in the street by using a bit of intel or a photo. Sherlock can examine civilians using his “Concentrate” ability and find a distinctive characteristic of the person he is looking for. In theory, he can also ask random NPCs about this person and, with some luck, receive relevant information about their whereabouts.

This doesn’t always work though. Cordona’s streets are usually crawled with many people living their lives and most of them won’t know about what you’re looking for. On one occasion, I asked dozens of NPCs if they knew a certain woman and none of them answered positively. Some of them were even rude, and I spent a considerable amount of time just running around the district until I found a woman, several blocks from my initial location, who pointed me in the right direction. This felt as if I’d advanced in the story merely by chance, breaking all the immersion and hard work put in by delicately presenting every clue until that point.

Sadly, this situation repeated itself a couple of times. During some segments, I needed to go to one of three archives, located in different buildings at the centre of the island, and find more information about a suspect or location. While most of the time I could solve these without issue, on some occasions the intel I had was too vague to realize which archive I should visit. This, again, meant I ended up running in circles, trying multiple options that lead nowhere and wasting valuable time. Even if the game has “difficulty” options for its puzzle-solving, the use of all the hints doesn’t prevent the player from getting stuck every now and then.

It’s important to explain that even if the game presents an open-world and multiple possible endings for each case, that doesn’t mean its structure isn’t linear most of the time. Sherlock usually needs to find the clues and evidence in a specific order, and he can’t progress further if he lacks any essential piece of evidence. Sure, you can find some extra clues that might change your conclusion, but that’s it. There isn’t anything inherently wrong with this approach, however, it’s a double-edged sword when considering some of these problems. Instead of feeling that I was spending my time becoming an ace detective, it sometimes felt more like playing roulette.

Not everything is a crime

Apart from solving the five cases from the main story, Sherlock Holmes and his friend will try to reveal the mystery about the death of Holmes’ mother. After each major case is complete, Sherlock will be allowed to visit his former house and explore a new room, full of memories about his childhood. These segments are incredibly crafted and they present some of the best dialogues between Sherlock and Jon, whose exchanges about life, the past and current events tend to be exquisitely involving.

Cordona is full of side cases that can be found by exploring the different districts, talking to NPCs, picking up posters on walls or recalling moments with Jon. Sometimes, they are simple cases that involve just a bit of exploration. On other occasions, they present surprising complexity. The need to find pieces of evidence, speak with multiple characters and find what’s going on with a lost violin, a ghost story and much more. These secondary missions are a nice excuse to freely explore the island, which also presents markets to buy new outfits for Sherlock, or furniture for his house.

On a different note, one aspect I haven’t touched on until now is combat. While at first it might seem interesting and a good addition to change the flow of the cases, it loses its freshness pretty quickly and becomes a boring gimmick after a few scenes. Sherlock’s fighting abilities include a revolver, limited slow motion when aiming and a special move that can blind enemies for a few seconds when fully charged. The game encourages you to nonfatally deal with the enemy. In order to do that, you have to shoot them in a specific part of their equipment or clothes — sometimes they carry an incendiary item, have a hat, or they’re wearing armour. Parts of the world can also be shot at to create a distraction and before rushing in to start a QTE that will put the enemy down.

The lack of variety in the combat makes it more of a nuisance than a feature. After your first battle against enemies, you have seen everything the game has to offer and it won’t change from there. Fortunately, you can select an option to skip all the combat sections from the beginning, but a well-thought system would have added another layer to the story.

Final Thoughts

It’s hard trying to summarize my experience with Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. On one hand, there are aspects that are brilliant and can fill you with great satisfaction when every piece of the puzzle falls into place. On the other hand, when the immersion is broken by obnoxious or random ways of finding the next clue, you’ll find your enjoyment of each case diminished.

Hopefully, the team at Frogwares can create a more refined tale for Chapter Two. The deeply uncomfortable notes within the game itself as I mentioned in the intro are one thing. However, even when it comes to the gameplay, while there’s certainly a lot of promise here, it never quite feels like it sticks the landing, which is a real shame.",Sherlock Holmes Chapter One Review

3 Mindlessly dull

It’s a rare bird that makes a mark on a largely forgettable genre that’s often associated with camp. And then, there’s Bloodshore. We thought we were free of interactive movies after the 90s/00s, but then Netflix put out Bandersnatch and had people fleetingly enthralled by the idea of a movie that gave you narrative options, as if the choose-your-own-adventure book hasn’t already been a perfectly good play staple for decades.

Wales Interactive, a company built on the brief resurgent wave of full-motion video (FMV) games around the mid-10s, has yet to do anything genuinely interesting with the concept, and yet to put out a truly exciting reinvigoration of the genre. Their repertoire involves, for the most part, stories that aren’t substantially very good, but still require you to make time-sensitive decisions that drag the plot along to a predictable end (will the heroine save ancillary character A or B, what will this mean for the outcome, so on, and so forth).

The basic premise of Bloodshore is Battle Royale/Fortnite/Hunger Games meets overclocked streaming culture—not an especially distant concept based on our current reality where corporations will do anything to get eyeballs, clicks, and money. In recent years, this particularly noxious breed of sensationalism took form as “Game2: Winter”—a Russian wilderness survival show where anything, including rape and murder, was supposedly “fair game.” Thankfully it turned out to be a market research experiment and not a real-life variation of dystopian fiction like The Running Man and most recently, Squid Game.

The corporate antagonist in Bloodshore is also Russian and runs the popular game series Kill/Stream, where “Z-list” personalities are dumped on an island and forced to kill their way to victory. We learn that the show’s debut season had a specific gimmick: the contestants were notorious death row inmates who fought for their freedom and went on to become famous and mind-bogglingly wealthy. But after Kill/Stream’s original creator, the enigmatic Eugene Christoph, stepped down, the show has devolved into a seasonal slopfest. Now, in the 13th season, they’re trying to claw back viewers with a change of scenery and new rules.

Not that Wanted

The real heroes of Bloodshore are its cast, a group of working actors that really makes the best of what they’re given. Protagonist Nick Romeo is an ex-child actor looking to redeem himself on Kill/Stream for his own reasons. The rest of his “drop group” is made up of awkward familiar stereotypes: Scarlett is the vapid, naive Instagrammer who isn’t remotely prepared for reality, Reah is a tough, confident MMA fighter, Otto is a cocky streamer whose fans are probably Gamergaters. There’s eye candy Gav (played by Glee alum and ex-boybander Max George), and Dev, a suspected cannibal who answers a very important aesthetic question: what if Julian Assange had grown up in Village of the Damned?

Altogether, this could have made for a passable bad movie that touches on important topics like the voracious nature of internet culture, the role of personal agency and individual choice in media consumption, streaming labor and exploitation, and other meta-issues that permeate our world. But Bloodshore chooses to be a mostly mindless experience where the choices you’re given don’t feel substantial or meaningful, which is literally all you can do for a player in this format. Even when you’re choosing whose life to save or to spare a comrade unnecessary torture, Nick’s reason for being on Kill/Stream is already pushed out in the open—it’s all already rigged, what does it matter?

Stuck in the 90s

There’s an especially hammy clip of a TV interviewer screaming at Eugene Christoph about how he can sit by and let his Kill/Stream erode our minds and bodies even further—that with every season of Kill/Stream, we stray further from god’s light, which isn’t wrong. But we don’t need these reminders or “how can you just sit there” rhetoric anymore—this isn’t the 1980s or 1990s or even 00s when there was still a kind of weird, raw excitement about web 2.0 and “social media” as a new part of everyday life. It’s 2021 and we’re all living in the same toxic mediascape that makes a fictional idea like Bloodshore possible.

Bloodshore’s whole vibe was exciting when I was a teenager and we had no mass lived experience of how technology was going to kick us back into Roman Colosseum-era levels of spectacle and complacency. There’s no sense of catharsis even when you get the “good ending” because the movie wasn’t engaging or well-written enough to at least give me the illusion of escape in the first place. When the characters yell and beat their chests about exploitation, there’s nothing behind it; Bloodshore is a poor, dull parody of its own message.

On the interactive front, there is no clear indication of save points. You’re forced to make an educated guess as to when you can stop playing, and end up having to replay a big chunk of D-movie quality content anyway. Even if it isn’t long to play, if you work in media and already have a decrepit soul hanging on by a thread, you will probably need a break. If you’re interested in hate-playing Bloodshore, it’s not even fun enough to do that with the requisite level of zest. The generic tracking options, as with other Wales Interactive productions, don’t make any sense. Romance with Tish, for instance, somehow goes up even though I turned her down and kept my distance from her at all possible points.

Decent production value and acting are all this has going for it. Even so, Bloodshore is one of many projects that don’t ever have to be interactive, and unfortunately, it won’t be the last of its kind.",The Indie Game Website

8 Comforting and clever

Moving is awful. Even when the circumstances are good—a new job, a new city, a new relationship—the process of condensing one’s life into a series of boxes, moving them, and fitting all those things into a new space is not what many of us would consider at all pleasant. Witch Beam Games, then, deserves a tremendous amount of credit for building a game centred entirely on the third of those steps that is clever, attractive, and engaging. Unpacking, a meditative puzzle game, tasks the player with pulling objects out of boxes and arranging them in a sensible manner in the new living space that the unseen main character is intending to occupy.

Each of these new spaces lines up with an event in the main character’s life—a new school, a new relationship, a new job—and much of the pleasure of playing Unpacking comes from the irresistible impulse to play the busybody. One might, for example, take interest in which childhood knick-knacks the main character brings to college and which she leaves at home. After devoting a tremendous amount of care to setting up the perfect workspace for her artistic pursuits, one may be a bit concerned that the new apartment (and the man who apparently lives there) seems to think that setting up a laptop and drawing tablet on the kitchen’s sole sitting area will be sufficient accommodation. While I don’t want to spoil the reader’s opportunity to play voyeur/detective on their own, the nature of the relocation that comes after this attempt at cohabitation is a bit heartbreaking even if it isn’t much of a surprise.

But, importantly, it isn’t the end, either. One’s path through life is not exactly a linear thing, and having to take a step back can be an opportunity to revisit, rediscover, and reinvent one’s self. (Or at least—spoiler—it is for Unpacking’s unseen main character.)

If Unpacking is something of a peanut butter sandwich of a game—that is, genuinely enjoyable comfort food rather than haute cuisine—it should still be recognised as good peanut butter on good bread. Telling a story in objects is a substantial accomplishment, and if Unpacking doesn’t quite reach the quirky, peculiar height of Gone Home or What Remains of Edith Finch, it still succeeds in being both particular and relatable. After arranging her objects seven or eight times (and dealing with her implied feedback when everything is unpacked but not quite yet in the “right” place), I feel like I have a sense of what the unnamed main character has been through. I know at least something about what she values, and what she has accomplished. I’m not entirely sure whether every single object is a souvenir of a dream accomplished or reflects an aspiration not yet realised, but I know at least that her degree now hangs proudly on the wall instead of having to be tucked away in someone else’s closet.

Third-person exploration

There’s a digression necessary here. I mentioned Gone Home and What Remains of Edith Finch and then just kept going, but while Unpacking falls into the same “story discovered by spending time in someone else’s domestic space” genre as those two games, there’s a fundamental difference. In both Gone Home and What Remains of Edith Finch, the player inhabits the role of a person whose condition mirrors the player’s inherent alienation from the space and objects being explored. Katie in Gone Home is returning after an absence to reconstruct her sister Samantha’s story, and Edith in What Remains of Edith Finch breaks into a house full of sealed rooms to uncover generations of tragedy in her family.

Unpacking, on the other hand, seems to want to encourage the player to identify with the unseen main character, which of course, is incompatible with a story that emerges through objects. While there’s always a bit of discovery in unpacking even a box one has packed one’s self—as I know all too well—every object is the result of events that the narrator already knows about, or choices she has already made. The player in effect plays the role of a domestic servant, intimately aware of a person’s objects and circumstances over time, but not reflected in them, and left to construct an understanding of someone else’s inner being over time. To my awareness, only Tale of Tales’ game Sunset has really played explicitly with this framing of a domestic employee in this genre.

This of course, isn’t really intended as a criticism of Unpacking. It’s just an incongruity. And incongruities can be really interesting.

Seeing yourself in objects

So where was I? Moving, in real life, is bad, or at least unpleasant. Unpacking, the game, is good, or at least very enjoyable. We carry ourselves in objects. They remain, even when we do not. We make them fit, even when we do not. I hate unpacking. I liked Unpacking very much. It’s complicated, but it’s as simple as a peanut butter sandwich, toasted in the sandwich press that you got three apartments ago.",The Indie Game Website

6 stylish but indistinct

Who doesn’t love a brawler? It is the spaghetti and meatballs of video games. It is tasty. It is filling. There’s little mystery to it. An auto-pilot meal when a day has you beat. But swap out too many of the key ingredients—the noodles, the sauce, the meatballs—and you’ll eventually find yourself talking about another pasta dish entirely. None of those permutative dishes will satiate the hunger you may have for spaghetti and meatballs, but you probably wouldn’t want, as Kirk Van Houten argued at a PTA meeting, two spaghetti meals in one day.

These beat ‘em up brawlers happen to be having a moment. River City Ransom, Streets of Rage, Battletoads, even the vaporware Scott Pilgrim game are all making comebacks. There’s a charming looking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle just around the corner. It’s more of a resurgence than a renaissance; the existence of games like Devil May Cry, Yakuza, Treachery in Beatdown City and Friends of Ringo Ishikawa are evidence that the genre’s renaissance already happened.

Tunche is a new brawler moulded by Peruvean folklore. It follows four young heroes (plus the Hat Kid from Hat in Time) each looking to confront the titular forest spirit for their own rites. While always an intimidating creature, Tunche’s terror in the Amazon has seemingly escalated, with other beasts imbued with fearsome powers and ripping a path of destruction.

Green Pastures

Tunche was successfully kickstarted back in 2019, and it’s not hard to see what drew fans to the project. Lush, colorful and tied together with vibrant character animations, Tunche’s picture book sensibilities are a nice treat. The monsters pestering the deep Amazon have some imaginative critters among them. I am especially fond of the scorpion hiding in a log like a hermit crab. The developers also promised a game that fuses beat-em-ups with roguelike elements: two genres that have often proved malleable.

There’s a bit to untangle in your first run. At least four separate types of stat points accumulate while bopping mean frogs and bad birds. From traditional coins and XP to more ethereal magics and orbs that can be spent on certain upgrades when starting back at camp, some resources are shared between characters, including couch co-op friends, while others are fixed. For example, you can chance-encounter ‘Cores’ during each run. Cores function similarly to Hades’ boons, except in Tunche you can permanently level up your favorites before heading out. Those boosts will apply to each hero across the board, though it never guarantees that anyone’ll stumble upon them on a run.

River Basin Ransom



Each of the five characters begin with three very standard, nearly identical attacks: a melee, a projectile and a launching uppercut. Their more distinctive combos and attacks require some grinding to unlock. Even basic abilities, like ground pounds and mid-air recoveries, have to be paid for in each character—which is where Tunche begins to feel short of what’s grand between its influences.

Rewards in Tunche are more generous if you maintain a high ‘style’ rating in each encounter. You achieve greater style by using more varieties of attacks and avoid getting dinged. These rewards can be very useful in unlocking new combos, but you may already start to sniff out what’s stubborn about this system. Starting with only three attacks, you will likely rely on repeating the same three-strike air and ground combos. That’ll generally hover you at a B rating. Even the Cores are means tested. Cores that can add lightning and poison effects to each attack only have a chance of working if your Style is above an A. That condition never changes even if you invest in levelling Cores up.

This peculiar system pays off if you’d like to preemptively buff up each character for when a friend comes over, but not if your chum wants to play with you from the get-go. Having to reach a later point where the combat makes itself more interesting doesn’t make for a compelling adventure. Enemies do considerably more damage as each level progresses (the dang fish can chomp off a fifth of your health). It makes sense as a way to close the gameplay loop and encourage you to master the earlier worlds, but worlds do not offer much more upon repeat visits. Set pieces, the greatest attraction brawlers have in their corner, do not exist in Tunche. Bosses, grotesque monster versions of otherwise cuddly snuggly animals, are Tunche at its best, but do not mix things up for rematches.

Style takes precedence

Games like Streets of Rage and Turtles in Time made themselves classics with audacious spectacles, making up for their inevitable elevator stages. Games like Enter the Gungeon, Hades and Binding of Isaac sweeten each run with distinct combat that swirls itself up on each visit, driving players to discover their favorite loadouts or enjoying the compromises when luck proves rotten.

Tunche does not do either of these things. Each stage is a field without so much as a hill. Alterations to combat are basically bottlenecked in the homebase, while randomised Cores do not really make much of a difference in how you scrap.

Little changes between each playthrough of Tunche, and not a whole lot happens during them. Tunche best serves fans and friends of dishing knuckle sandwiches together, but doesn’t synchronise its genre mashups in a way that elevates it above the many RPG-tinted beat ‘em ups stomping around out there.",The Indie Game Website

9 A brilliant sequel

Darkest Dungeon 2 is an incredibly smart sequel. Instead of just giving us more Darkest Dungeon, which would have been more than adequate given the original’s quality, Red Hook has taken its eldritch horrors and gloomy gothic aesthetic and injected that into a more structured roguelike system. Though this does mean we lose some of the systems that are now a trademark of Darkest Dungeon, the move toward a more focused experience mostly succeeds in cutting some fat from the original title and making Darkest Dungeon 2 an absolute thrill.

In Darkest Dungeon 2, you are tasked with taking the last flame of hope through a series of increasingly grizzly paths up toward a mountain top, where a great evil needs to be slain. As Darkest Dungeon 2 is currently in Early Access, the only “confession” available is “denial” (the themes of each playthrough seem to be focused around the five stages of grief).

The differences between the original title and its sequel become apparent early on when you are tasked with choosing your party. Unlike the first game, where you had a whole host of different adventurers who would form a larger party, each attempt in Darkest Dungeon 2 lets you pick a completely new and fresh set of adventurers based on their class. This does have the adverse effect of seeing the tortured souls you are taking on this carriage journey from hell as yet another nameless henchman; after all, they will most likely die. It’s a roguelike after all; dying is the whole thing.

But it does also mean that, when the turn-based combat sequences kick in, you are encouraged to try inventive and braver combat manoeuvres. There’s no leaving poor Derek the Highwayman at the base to recover.

No point in friendships

Speaking of home-base, there isn’t one. All the people management mechanics of the original have been removed to facilitate the move toward a roguelike format. That, in many ways, is a shame. There isn’t another game quite like Darkest Dungeon for its blend of exploration, combat and asset management, especially within its delightfully grotesque gothic horror setting. But the move to a roguelike system has allowed Red Hook to focus on making combat, stress and item management alongside party dynamics more fluid and effective within the confines of time-limits and increasingly difficult enemy encounters. By and large, these systems all work exceptionally, and at no point did I feel like I didn’t have a grasp on what items I had, or how to effectively use them.

The party management aspect definitely needs some tweaking, however. Getting stressed out and adversarial toward your comrades is far more likely than nurturing friendships for your crew, however, which is an issue when just moving through the world can rack up the blood pressure for some adventurers. When adversarial, your party will purposely harm allies, from de-buffing to outright blocking healing attempts. This would be fine if the benefits to maxing out a friendship offered an equivalent buff, but this just isn’t the case. Because of this, the stress system adds an artificial difficulty to the game. As Darkest Dungeon 2 is currently in Early Access, these are the types of issues one may be resolved in the future.

New combat

The combat is where Darkest Dungeon 2 truly shines. The game has kept the core fundamentals of what made the first game so fun. Dramatic zoom shots on hits, alongside exquisite narration that describes the action and surprisingly deep and satisfying tactical nuance. Having a party that conforms to a more role-based format gives encounters a much-needed balance. In the first game, I often found myself choosing un-balanced parties as other members stayed back at the inn to lower their stress levels–or died–but that’s not an issue here. This allowed me to take the time to find combos that would buff my party and de-buff enemies efficiently.

The roguelike genre requires players to master the combat to ensure victory, and applying this to turn-based combat has resulted in the balance of clever tactics and electrifying Hail Mary plays. Unlike the original, failure in Darkest Dungeon 2 doesn’t translate to starting over at the beginning of the dungeon with zero resources and untrained henchmen, but instead just sets you back at the start. It’s a learning experience that will make the next run easier.

Darkest Dungeon 2, even in its Early Access state, is a marvellous roguelike that offers players a whole host of avenues with which to approach the game’s numerous encounters. There are definitely issues surrounding difficulty, as well as the occasionally dropped text line or repetitive dialogues that anyone playing a game in Early Access would expect. Though Darkest Dungeon 2 may take players to dark and horrible places, it is a glowing example of how new systems can be effectively applied to a well-established setting and aesthetic.",Darkest Dungeon 2 (Early Access) Review

6 Very promising

Have you ever tried really hard to like something? Maybe it’s a specific food everyone else goes crazy over; perhaps it’s a song constantly played on the radio, or maybe it’s a game that you’ve been excited about for so long that you now feel obligated to enjoy? Well, I have, and that game is Moonglow Bay.

That said, here’s something I never thought I’d be writing: I quite enjoyed my time in Moonglow Bay; some might even go as far as to say I’m hooked on it. If you’d spoken to me a few days ago, however, my opinion on Moonglow Bay wouldn’t have been even close to as positive.

There’s no use sugar-coating it: when I jumped into Moonglow Bay on launch, I did not enjoy a single second of my time in it, even though it’s a game that, by every measure, should have been right up my alley. I’m also not alone in that opinion. A quick browse through Steam’s reviews will show dozens of players, echoing the same feelings of disappointment and frustration with the game. My personal favourite review is just one word: “No.”

Might be worth playing

One of the first opinions I jotted down when playing Moonglow Bay was that even if the developers sorted out all the glitches, bugs and issues, I still wasn’t convinced that the game would be worth playing, and that was because there was barely a game beneath these bugs; it largely felt empty and pointless. I was sure you would be better off casting your line elsewhere. However, starting up the game again post-patch, I could finally see the gem of a game that was there all the time.

The story behind Moonglow Bay is a sentimental and novel one. You play as someone who moved with their partner to a little fishing town, only to have your partner disappear under mysterious circumstances. The village of Moonglow Bay always had a superstitious fear of the waters surrounding it, and your partner’s disappearance only spurred this on. Fast forward to a few years later, and you are now a middle-aged individual drowning in your heartbreak and fast food packaging. But while you’ve spent the last three years falling apart at home, Moonglow Bay has been breaking at the seams too. A surprise visit from your daughter convinced you to start living your life again–and give Moonglow bay a second chance at survival as well.

Still cosy and relaxing

At its core, Moonglow Bay is a relaxing and cosy game about love, dealing with loss and finding yourself, regardless of age. Starting Moonglow Bay is a speedy and straightforward experience; you are given three pre-made characters to choose from, you then get to pick your name and your pronoun. You then select your partner out of a choice of three and their preferred pronoun, and that’s it; you’re ready to go. And throughout the game, you will spend your days fishing, and your nights cooking. The money you make selling your fellow villager’s favourite meals to them will be spent on improving the town around you.

Moonglow Bay is simple, from its Voxel art style to its combat free playstyle, and yet simple never equates to empty or dull. Whether it’s petting your dog (adorably named Waffles), talking to the other residents, taking a new type of fish you caught to the aquarium or cooking up a meal for the lovely old lady down the street; there is always something for you to do, although there is never a sense of urgency to any of it – which could very easily be a pro or a con, depending on what experience you’re looking for.

Life after patching

I will say that my game experience drastically improved after the controller support got fixed. Yes, you can play Moonglow Bay with a keyboard, but you shouldn’t if you can help it. The whole experience is just so much more relaxing when you can curl up with pillows and blankets and just get lost in the music while playing instead of having to sit right by your keyboard and perform constant finger gymnastics–but that’s just me.

Starting up the game again post-patch, I could finally see the gem of a game that was there all the time. Moonglow Bay still has a long way to go; the movement still feels overly clunky, the fishing is severely lacking, considering that it’s the selling point of the game, and the camera is at times so bad I feel like I’m back in the 90s again.

However, looking at the progress the game has made in just a week fills me with hope that before long Moonglow Bay is going to reflect the labor of love that it clearly is. Even though I don’t see myself swapping out my go-to “rainy day” games like Stardew Valley or Moonlighter for Moonglow Bay anytime soon, I’m also not ready to say that I definitely won’t. The amount of progress that the game made in just a week and a single patch has given me nothing but hope for its future, and it’s a game I’ll be keeping an eye on in the weeks to come.

Moonglow Bay also supports local coop, and while I’ll always support anything that allows me to play with friends, the game feels like an almost personal experience that I didn’t ever feel the urge to invite someone to share with me. So with that, I’ll leave you with my closing thoughts of Moonglow Bay: Not bad, cod be better.",Moonglow Bay Review

6.5 A slow journey

I have a complicated relationship with MMOs that’s steadily evolved over the years. I suck at them. Not through lack of skill or experience, at least in this particular context, rather that I can never play them properly. Despite having the opportunity—and of course being heavily encouraged—to play and go questing with countless players from all over the world, ultimately I end up wandering off on my own into the wilds, and it becomes another solo RPG adventure.

So when a game comes along that pitches an adventure truly of your choosing and meeting other players as rare and fleeting should you wish it, it will naturally elicit my best meerkat impression.

Coining the term ‘TMO’ or ‘Tiny Multiplayer Online’, Book of Travels by Swedish studio Might and Delight entered Early Access in October 2021 and puts you into the role of a wanderer in the vast, majestic landscape of the Braided Shore. Your beginnings, your journey, what you learn and delve into along the way: all of this is to be decided by the choices you make. Whether you choose to become versed in the properties of plants, be a danger seeker or simply follow the winds and keep walking, your story is just that: yours. Yours for the shaping.

Choosing forms

When creating a character, rather than choosing a race or class, you have a selection of ‘forms’ to choose from. These each have a couple of starting skills and serve more as a foundation for you to imprint your own ideas and personality onto. Choosing your upbringing will give you a brief sentence describing it. Take the Mystical for example: “Your child spirit was open to the mysteries. You spent your youth learning to control your mystic gifts”. What this means for your character, if anything at all, is unclear. Are my spells more effective? Do I learn them more quickly? Or is it simply a descriptor? So many questions already.

Once you’ve moulded a form to your satisfaction, you set out into the world. And in the words of a certain Mr Armstrong’s “What a Wonderful World”, and inspired by Eastern art and aesthetics, the delicate watercolour landscape of the Braided Shore is truly unique and captivating. Instantly you feel as though you’ve stepped into the threads of an ancient tapestry.

Making conversations

Might and Delight are very up front about how Book of Travels is for wayfinders, and that it won’t plan your route. After a brief tutorial covering some of the game’s elements, you are literally set adrift: pick a direction, head out and see what you discover. Players who are well versed in the realms of tabletop RPGs will feel very much at home. There’s a similar vibe to the story-centric tabletop game Tales of the Arabian Nights about it, minus the quest markers. Depending on the locations you investigate, the events you stumble on or the NPCs you talk to, your character will gain experience and snippets of lore that may or may not be useful in your travels. But again, the extent of this is completely unknown. And speaking of the coined term ‘Tiny Multiplayer Online’? It’s not hyperbole. Each server is limited to seven or eight players each and meeting them is indeed rare. But should you meet a fellow wanderer, there are ‘encounters’ which require co-operation in order to complete.

The communication mechanic is also one of the more interesting elements. Instead of a chat box, you have a selection of icons representing different words or emotions that grows the more you discover. A clever reflection of two people of different languages trying to converse through sporadically learned words or gestures.

Slow-paced journey

Perhaps it’s a given for some, but one aspect of the Book of Travels experience cannot be stressed enough: this game is a slow burner. Intensely so. That’s not necessarily a bad thing and as mentioned earlier, Might and Delight are very up front about how much of a departure the game is from what you’d expect. But even the disclaimer doesn’t quite prepare you for the considerably slower pace of the game, and many may get caught off guard by it. For some, this can be a counterpoint to the over-the-top grindy atmosphere of traditional MMOs, which will be a breath of fresh air. For others, this will be an energy-sapper. As for myself, I drifted back and forth in between, but slightly more towards the latter than I’d hoped.

Being in Early Access, bugs are of course fairly prevalent and content is a little on the thin side. With nothing to help influence your decisions, it’s easy to find yourself doing very little. Having an affinity for the mystical and being a good Brit, I’d decided to strive to become a savant of Knots (the equivalent of spells) and brew a colossal amount of different tasty teas. But after hours of gameplay, I had barely come across any NPCs nor done much more than picking flowers in a seemingly endless field. And perhaps my skills are indeed wanting after all, but I couldn’t figure out how to brew tea for the life of me. As a Brit (and a Northerner to boot), oh the shame!

Ultimately, Book of Travels is indeed an experience unlike any other, and despite its flaws, it has numerous intriguing elements and a great deal of potential. If your imagination and inspiration is boundless, then you will find a wealth of adventure and enjoyment. If you need a game that offers direction and structure, turn back traveller. Your adventure lies elsewhere.",Book of Travels (Early Access) Review

7 Creative puzzles

How would you keep a player captivated between bouts of intense puzzle solving? In many games, the solution is to stuff some semblance of a backstory in any crevice possible: a faded family picture in the background, an awkward conversation between two long-lost friends, a slight grimace etched on the protagonist’s face as they thought about a painful memory.

But Where Cards Fall, a card-based puzzle game about stacking house-like structures and paving a route towards your goal, chose to dispense with these minutiae in its coming-of-age tale. Its protagonist has no discernable expression, conversations are carried out in a fictional language, and the environment is mostly bare, save for some elegant, if not generic, props. It attempts to tell a story with minimalist details, but you can only draw vague inferences to the pantomime that’s taking place on screen. All the character motivation that propels the game forward is for naught if you can’t really understand what’s going on.

If the absence of a moving adolescent tale, such as the likes of Oxenfree, may leave the game feeling like disparate parts of a whole, then perhaps the strength of its puzzles—which are both creative and eye-catching—may draw you back in. What’s immediately apparent, despite the game’s barely-there context, is that the protagonist is traversing across landscapes that represent their key memories, as they reminisce the events that took place in their teenage years, all the way through adulthood. You’ll need to make your way towards the end of the level, which is represented by a solitary card, to move on towards the next one. To do so, you’ll be constructing houses, platforms and buildings of varying size and heights with stacks of cards.

Deck of houses

There are some limitations, however. For instance, decks denoted by a square means that the structures you build will be square-shaped, whereas decks labelled with a triangle can be stacked to form a more triangular roof, which allows the protagonist to climb on top of them to get to hard-to-reach places. In later levels, more hazards and obstacles are introduced, such as cloud-like platforms that are depressed the more card structures are placed on them, and passing wind that can easily blow your house of cards over. Then there are the landscapes that make up these levels—which range from seaside scenes to tranquil dreamscapes strewn with personal articles and paraphernalia. The basics of these puzzles would need a bit of getting used to, particularly with its fiddly controls on the Switch, but they are largely compelling brain teasers that reward your hard work with a rush of dopamine. And if all else fails, there’s also a handy hint system that will get you out of most tight spots.

These puzzles are the bite-sized, whimsical charm that propel Where Cards Fall, but it could still do with cutting the fat off its mind-boggling puzzles. Each time you’ve completed one of them, you’ll be introduced to an unskippable and largely non-interactive cutscene on some pivotal memory of the teenage protagonist, which feels like an obligatory and unnecessary inclusion after a while. My attention wanes, and I’m quite ready to move on from whatever larger-than-life dramatics, tenderness and awkwardness of the protagonist’s teenage years.",Where Cards Fall Review

9 Short but moving

Sunday, September 27th, 2054, Shibukawa City, Japan. Anna Isobe wakes up massively hungover, with her lover Rick at her side. Your boss angrily wakes you up to tell you it’s time to go to work. It’s raining outside, but there’s something wrong with the lights. Time to get up and investigate what’s wrong.

The Sundew is developed by Studio 2054, a one-woman video game studio by French developer Agnes “Clemenc” Vuillaume. This point-and-click game has been her passion project since years ago, and Vuillaume certainly succeeds at building a genuinely entertaining narrative arc based on a cyberpunk world. It thoroughly enthralls players through their journey as Anna Isobe, an officer of the Shibukawa Police who is having a really bad day.

After the short but helpful tutorial, you head to Anna’s workplace, the Shibukawa City Police Headquarters, where you will be quickly introduced to your coworkers Jimmy, Donna, Neo, and Karin. Through some snarky and comedic banter, you get to know more about Anna’s relationship with them.

Point and sleuth

Yet from your conversations with your colleagues, it’s difficult not to note the underlying tone of distress in their voices over the current state of the world. It’s this grim narrative that renders The Sundew’s cyberpunk-themed world authentic; it’s one that’s treated with respect rather than twisted into an overly edgy tale.

Through the dialogue, imagery, and lore, Shibukawa City is shown to contain greater multitudes than it appears at first glance, with streets that are full of vitality and buzz with the usual activity of a city, but also home to abandoned ruins with echoes of times past. The amalgam of such contrasting scenery makes for an interesting, story-driven setting, rather than serving as just a superficially luminous city. It’s an impressive feat, given the game’s short length and the story’s rapid pace.

When a physical examination goes unexpectedly bad and one of Anna’s coworkers mysteriously disappears, the state of affairs becomes increasingly suspicious as you are sent to investigate another assassination. What seems to be another normal day at work will soon get you entangled in a twisted web of lies, deception, and violence, as you make critical decisions, often with unexpected results.

Cyberpunk wonder



When things go south, or whenever you simply need to figure out where to head next, how you interact with your environment becomes a crucial part of your experience. I may be biased because I love point-and-click adventures, but it’s worth noting how satisfying puzzle-solving feels throughout the game. From having to put an aspirin in a glass full of water to fix a bad hangover, to mixing up complex chemical reactions in plants so as to improvise an escape through a hole behind a wall of vines, I hardly felt stuck, punished, or coddled by the game, with the clues never feeling too obvious or needlessly hard to crack.

Ultimately, the only flaw was the sensation of wanting more of The Sundew. While its length can feel underwhelming, it is still an achievement since it’s developed by one person, which is even more admirable after seeing the quality of the final product. The fact that the game left me craving for more adventures like this speaks volumes of the developer’s dedication, as well as a testament to the beautifully presented cyberpunk adventure of The Sundew.",The Sundew Review

7 A moving tale

Undying begins in a post-apocalyptic world ridden with zombies. On one particular day, government soldiers attempt to escort mother Anling and her son Cody to a safe encampment. However, they are attacked by zombies, and Anling is bitten and infected when she shields Cody. Although a soldier is able to provide cover fire for Anling and Cody to escape in an abandoned car, the two are now on their own.

Not only must the player control Anling and ensure she survives, but they also must teach Cody skills that will help him and his mother live another day.

Playing as Anling provides a unique perspective that is rarely seen in survival horror games. In fact, the closest comparison to Undying’s Anling and Cody is The Last of Us’s Joel and Elle. What’s more is that there aren’t many horror survival games where you play as a mother and child, and only a small handful where you play as a woman of color. And as you scavenge for supplies, you’ll also need to fight off zombies as the duo, while searching for the whereabouts of a safe encampment.

Given Anling’s condition, there is a delicate balancing act when it comes to controlling both her and Cody. You can’t go too far from Cody in case a zombie is nearby and you also won’t be able to travel to another area on the world map unless Cody is behind you. Sometimes, Cody will be able to hide from zombies in a trash can so you can kill the zombies before moving on. At the same time, Anling can’t take too much damage from zombies because there are little supplies to replenish health.

Survival is tough

The point is to guide Anling and Cody through different locations, as you search for supplies and clues to where the safe encampment is. Although their house serves as a base, it is riddled with fixable broken equipment and lack of basic necessities such as food, clean water, and medical items, which you’ll need to get by.

That said, you have a bag for carrying raw materials and rations, and a menu to monitor Anling’s and Cody’s status, even if these features are somewhat limited. If you want to fix broken equipment, you can track the amount of wood or scrap metal you need. You can also track Cody’s skills to see what he needs to do in order to level up abilities such as carpentry or patience. For instance, Cody may need to learn to make food, recycle, or scavenge a certain number of items to grow his stats.

However, you have to choose between either nurturing Cody’s stats or overseeing tracking equipment, because the game doesn’t allow you to keep tabs on both at once. Not only does this make fixing multiple equipment inefficient, but this also makes staying ahead of your circumstances particularly challenging.

Slowed down

While gathering items and clues to the encampment’s whereabouts, you have to use your in-game time carefully. Time is measured in days and as it passes, Anling and Cody will suffer from hunger and thirst that affect their movement speed. Since Anling is infected, she will also suffer fatigue in the evening, which can only be cured by having ample rest, as well as status effects that appear after two days, such as gout, which limits travel and causes Anling’s health to drop every time she rushes in to save Cody from a zombie.

However, these statuses are not random; they can be chosen by the player. The status effects were a nice touch that showed how Anling’s initial zombie bite is affecting her. At the same time, Cody’s mood is also affected by dialogue choices when he converses with Anling. Picking a calm response will keep Cody composed, but a panicked reply will make Cody feel doubtful or collapse from fear entirely.

As I started teaching Cody vital skills, such as making clean water and collecting scrap metal to build useful objects, I noticed how desolate the world was: the abandoned cars a reminder of a pre-apocalypse world, and the streets littered with blood and defeated zombies. Enhancing this atmosphere was a bleak piano score, memos that served as tiny clues about the encampment, and short cutscenes with Anling and Cody.

One particular cutscene added a touch of humanity to Anling and Cody as characters as well as the game’s story. When Cody picks up a slingshot in the backyard of their home, Anling decides to teach him how to use it, since Anling’s missing husband never got around to it. Cody happily responds, with the duo bonding for a brief moment, rather than just struggling to survive.

Undying is about characters who care deeply for each other while desperately clinging to survival. This mother and son’s survival journey is filled with challenges, but also a lot of heart. Despite some minor hiccups, Anling’s and Cody’s story is achingly compelling, as they find ways to help each other stay alive, as well as reasons to live in the moment.",Undying (Early Access) Review

8.5 Invigorating puzzles

One of the most ubiquitous hacking scenes in popular culture is to smash many, many indecipherable words very, very quickly on the keyboard, all while several interfaces and ominous charts materialise on the screen in dizzying, rapid succession. It sure makes hacking look like a particularly exhilarating cyberpunk-ish sport, although not all of that spectacle is completely fictional; real-life ethical hackers have talked about the rush of adrenaline whenever they discover a leak or vulnerability in security systems.

Wrapped in the veneer of these popular hacking tropes, Midnight Protocol is very good at making you feel like a bona fide hacker, even if it doesn’t always replicate the heart-palpitating rush of cyber warfare. The entire game takes place via a computer interface, as you adopt the perspective of Data, a hacktivist whose identity was leaked by a rival hacker named Kraken. Fresh out of prison, you’re back in the game and ready to dive right back into your previous life, while attempting to uncover who Kraken is, and why they had doxxed you in the first place. More than that, you’ll also be embroiled in a web of grand conspiracies and moral dilemmas, as you hack—which is essentially a whole lot of typing, as I’ll explain later—and maneuver your way through the thick digital viscera of the internet, drenched in data and code.

You start Midnight Protocol by logging into your computer: typing out your username and password by tapping random keys on your keyboard, like one of those hacker simulator websites that lets you pretend you’re a badass movie hacker. Then you’ll be directed to your home screen, a mostly monochromatic interface where you can check your emails, look at your logs, surf the intranet, purchase hardware and software off the black market, and access networks you’ve found to hack into and begin your data heist. Rather than dabbling in unnecessary visual flourishes, this operating system looks almost barebones, although there’s admittedly quite a bit to do: you’ll be spending the bulk of your time going through emails, engaging in good ol’ fashioned bouts of hacking, and improving your hacking arsenal by purchasing more ammunition—in the form of viruses, stealth programs that cloak your traces, and a litany of other software.

Hack into the mainframe

But let’s dive right into the core of Midnight Protocol, which is undoubtedly all the nifty hacking you’ll be carrying out. Fortunately, the first few levels ease you into this rhythm seamlessly. In contrast to the largely text-based interface at the start, hacking in Midnight Protocol is visually presented in the form of physical networks, and functions similarly to rounds of turn-based combat. This is aside from the fact that your goal is usually to make your way towards and interact with a specific node—a point in the hacked network where various pathways will intersect. That can be a data node, in which you’re stealing data; a finance node, where you can drain credits (i.e., money); or even to install a virus on a regular connector node. During your turn, you’re allowed two moves, after which the network’s cybersecurity measures will take over and execute whatever anti-intrusion programs that are being run. In later levels, certain networks will even deploy SysOps, which are roving targets that would actively search for where you’re located and attempt to boot you out of the network.

True to the mythos of pop culture hacking, making counter moves means cooly typing out commands you plan to execute, be it simply moving from one node to the next, or searching for Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics—or ICE—which are the anti-intrusion programs that would thwart your hacking attempts. While this may seem initially daunting, since you’ll need to learn how to execute a flurry of programs from “sniffer” to “gatekeeper”, these steps can be easily picked up, due to tutorial levels where their effects are explained and doled out in small, manageable doses. Hacking soon becomes surprisingly intuitive, as you’ll be running more programs in a blink of an eye, as well as furiously tap-tap-tapping away on your keyboard with the apparent dexterity of a skilled hacker. And as you scale up in difficulty and access much more secure networks, you’ll have to strategise and decipher the most effective way of reaching your goal. You will even employ cool hacking tricks, such as social engineering, to gain access to nodes that are locked behind a password by sleuthing around, or making intelligent guesses, as to what the password is.

Bypass the firewall

The neatest trick that Midnight Protocol pulled is that even if it probably does not depict hacking in the most realistic or accurate manner, it still encapsulates the fascination that most of us have around hacking. In many ways, that feels like a suitable metaphor for cyberpunk, as it succinctly captures the intrigue and conspiracies of a tech dystopia in one act: the depraved megacorporations, the sophisticated tech, the notion of living off the digital grid, and more. At times, Midnight Protocol does these by tossing you into the thick of it all: you’ll be assigned jobs that will put your morality to the test, make difficult decisions that may impede your progress, or simply be placed in situations where you’ll be tempted to flex your hacking muscles and break into every node you see, even if that’s incredibly frowned upon.

The latter is also one of the reasons I keep going back to Midnight Protocol, because being a hacker in Midnight Protocol is fun. Partaking in the thrill of this seemingly illicit activity, testing and breaking the boundaries of every network, and breaching the multiple cybersecurity defences that are being put up against your incursion—these are just some of the ridiculous stunts that only movie hackers can pull off. Like the group of teenage hackers from the 1995 film Hackers, I’m part of an elaborate hacking performance, and the tension is so darn electrifying.",Midnight Protocol Review

7 Intriguing and engaging

Grotto is a walking sim… but the extent of your walking takes you back and forth between two chambers of a cave, over and over. It’s a choice-driven narrative adventure… where you’re often unsure what the choice is, exactly, that you’re making. It’s a first-person action game… but the actions are throwing bones to hold a seance, smoking a pipe to commune with the dead, and gazing at the stars to form constellations and attempt to divine the future. Boiled down to its essence, Grotto is an FPS: a first-person soothsayer.

You are the soothsayer in question, a hermitic fortune teller who spends their days taking questions from a string of anthropomorphic animal visitors, and attempting to find answers using magical means. At first, these visits seem unrelated. Over time though, it becomes clear that your patrons belong to a nearby tribe in the midst of rising conflict. Each wants your advice for different decisions both minor and major. You will help villagers decide the fate of their own lives and the village as a whole.

What sets Grotto apart from other narrative driven games, though, is how murky the decision-making process is. Each session concludes with a patron asking you to present them a constellation—which you view through a hole in the cave roof and store for later as paintings on a wall—that will, in some way, speak to their condition. Present the scorpion constellation, for example, and it might communicate that they should sting their friends in the back. On the other hand, it might indicate that someone they trust is going to betray them. And that’s just one of many constellations which can all be interpreted in multiple different ways. Like I said, murky.

First-person advice giver

It’s interesting to describe the game this way from the vantage point of having completed it because while playing Grotto, it often feels overly simplistic and repetitive. But that’s because most of its mechanical depth is hidden beneath the incredibly stylised Darkest Dungeon-esque surface. As you play, the verbs at your disposal are simple. Wake up, walk to the next chamber where one of your patrons is waiting, talk to them, walk to the constellation wall and pick one, walk back to your patron, present the constellation, listen to their response. Repeat all those steps once more and it’s probably time to go to bed. Then, you do it all again.

Over time, the mechanics that I mentioned above get added to the mix. Before you select a constellation, you may want to seek the wisdom of the dead. But, functionally, these are a hint system—sometimes reliable, sometimes not—more than mechanics in their own right. So, that leaves picking constellations. You go to the wall. You look at the dozen-plus constellations. You read the mythopoetic descriptions that accompany them. You choose one and hope for the best. This is Grotto at its most complex and yet, it isn’t that complex.

Indirect consequences

What keeps the game engaging over the course of a playthrough is the depth of the storytelling on display, and how strangely removed you are from your interactions. I don’t think I’ve ever played a game where the consequences of my actions were entirely related to me secondhand.

But that’s the approach Grotto takes, and it’s fascinating to hear how villagers following your advice (or misinterpreting it) plays out. Though the process of playing it can occasionally drift into tedium, it’s worth working through the repetition to see the game to its eventual conclusion. In Grotto your choices matter. But they matter in the same way your choices matter in the real world: in ways you can’t see in the moment and may never see at all.",The Indie Game Website

6 Admirable but buggy

In a time when there are more small game development teams than ever, the roguelike format has proven itself to be a cost-effective way to get the most out of limited resources. Procedural generation can reshuffle a few components into levels that stay fresh, while permadeath simultaneously raises the stakes of each encounter and stretches out play times until players meet a certain threshold of mastery. And on top of all that, the core principles are malleable enough that they can be incorporated into a wide range of genres.

Heartless Dark, by solo developer iamRoarke, is the latest example. Seemingly comprised of a few dozen black-and-white, barely animated assets, it does more with less. The genre being folded into the roguelike this time? Deliberate, clunky survival-horror.

On its own this mashup isn’t earth-shattering, but it does set the stage for the game’s primary hook.

SOUND DECISION-MAKING

Armed with a gun, some grenades, and a woefully wimpy flashlight, you learn quickly that your sense of sight isn’t going to take you far in Heartless Dark’s infested cubicles. The “Sixth Sense” you activate by turning off your flashlight can give you a fuzzy picture of your surroundings, but even that is no match for your second sense–hearing. Startling, grating, and crude, Heartless Dark’s soundscape–and the way it’s capable of guiding your every decision–is easily its strongest aspect.

It kicks off with the blaring of the drill that opens an entry to Hell and releases a flood of demons into the underground offices of the clearly corrupt Malum Co. As you descend the floors one by one, you’ll fight your way through an array of monsters that each have their own sonic hallmark. Poisonous slugs slurp and gargle, swarms of bats rustle and flap, and stationary spike monsters (urchins?) tremble like china cabinets in a train station. Over time these sounds etch themselves in your memory, and add up to your most responsive and detailed source of situational awareness.

LAUGHAPABOOZA

Heartless Dark might look like a horror game, but take it from me, a certified scaredycat: it’s not all that scary. There are surprises, sure, but horror requires tension, and this game breaks it in more ways than one. The first is that completing a floor requires dispatching most of its lurking demons, which turns you from a frightened ex-employee into an assassin with the ability to see through walls, who methodically takes out their targets one by one.

The second is that Heartless Dark is at times genuinely funny. Take for instance the jangly muzak that greets you every time the elevator opens to take you to another floor. Or the stacks of boxes labeled, in all-caps black marker, TYPO. Occasionally (and delightfully) otherwise normal pieces of furniture will let out possessed groans as they violently hurl themselves in your direction. My personal favorites are the filing cabinets that die, throwing open their drawers, in a flurry of documents and manila envelopes.

UNSAFE WORKING CONDITION

Unfortunately, this all comes with a significant caveat. In my time with Heartless Dark I experienced persistent crashes, to the extent that I haven’t been able to finish the game. Within a single play-session of roughly three hours, the game stopped responding on four different occasions, always between levels. It seemed to be most frequent in the second region, “Mines,” where almost every run ended this way. I can’t be sure exactly how widespread this problem is, and although there’s a chance the kinks will be worked out eventually, I can’t guarantee you won’t have the same issues.

Between its inspired sonics and literally off-the-wall goofiness, Heartless Dark is an admirable effort I wish I could recommend without reservation, but without knowing how reliably it will run, I can only hope it gets better in time. For now at least, proceed with caution.",Heartless Dark Review

5 Infuriating and tedious

Astria Ascending is one of the most infuriating games I have played in a long time. Not because it’s broken, morally corrupt or any other reason worth the amount of emotional heartache this title from Final Fantasy alumni Kazushige Nojima has given me. Astria Ascending, for all the quirks that would put a lot of players off but draw a JRPG masochist like me in, commits the worst sin of all: it’s just not fun to engage with.

In Astria Ascending, you take control of the 333rd Demi-Gods of Orcanon. This prismatic crew of characters from the various nations of Orcanon are tasked with ensuring the continued protection of harmony—which is an actual theological belief, not a turn of phrase. To do this they must explore the depths of the nation, destroying “noises” through turn-based combat all whilst foiling the plot of a nefarious bad guy. So far, so good.

The story is as convoluted as you would expect from a new JRPG, with the introduction throwing enough lore at you to make the first 100 pages of Fellowship Of The Ring feel like a post-apocalyptic young adult novel. Yet it remains interesting enough. The art style, a hand-painted 2D side-scrolling affair, is absolutely stunning. Each enemy, landscape and Demi-God has its own unique aesthetic that makes Astria Ascending feel distinct within the ever-expanding JRPG landscape. The score, from another Final Fantasy veteran Hitoshi Sakimoto, is breathtaking, as it captures the soundscape of this diverse land majestically. But no matter how good this game looks and sounds, it’s the moment you engage with it that this veneer of intrigue starts to chip.

Unintentionally comedic

I’ll begin with my favourite but flawed aspect of the game: the voice acting. If you want to take Astria Ascending seriously, play the game in Japanese. The Japanese delivery is good and it certainly makes some of the more ludicrous story beats feel more compelling. However, the English performances are just bizarre. There’s definitely a sense that COVID restrictions hindered the recording process for this game, with each line of dialogue flowing from one to the other with the grace of an elephant on stilts. But the delivery of said lines is awful—original Resident Evil awful. There is a certain charm to it all, however. The absurdity of what they’re saying—and how they’re saying it—often brings a smile to my face, though I am sure this wasn’t the actors’ intention.

Another issue with Astria Ascending is when you have to play the game. The game sets itself up to be as approachable as possible. You can fine-tune settings to make the game as easy or difficult as you would like. You can chop and change your party mid-battle and even teleport out of dungeons with very little penalties. But these dungeons are an absolute slog to get through.

Confusing navigation

These issues can be split into two: combat and exploration.

The very best turn-based JRPGs will make win conditions obvious. In Persona for instance, if you sneak up on an enemy, you will always get the initiative for that combat encounter. In Astria Ascending, this combat initiative feels random. I could freeze an enemy in place, hop over them and then initiate combat and they would still get to go first. This would be fine if the enemies didn’t have so many status effect moves in their arsenal.

In one notoriously infuriating combat encounter, the enemies would constantly inflict the whole party with “confuse”—locking me out of doing anything within that turn whilst my Demi-Gods attacked each other and healed the enemy. The enemy AI, even on the lower difficulties, will do everything in its power to make your life difficult. Not in a fun, problem-solving way, but by wrestling control away from you. At points, I might as well have been playing an idle game as I watched for two or three minutes, whilst my stunned and confused Demi-Gods ripped themselves apart until it was game over. The worst thing a turn-based game can do is make you feel powerless, and often, that’s how I felt.

Exploration of Astria Ascending’s sprawling world is its most pressing issue yet. The major downside to the game’s gorgeous 2D art style is that working out where you’re heading is a challenge. The best 2D platformers or Metroidvanias make their foregrounds and backgrounds as distinct as possible to ensure the player knows exactly what can be interacted with, while subtly controlling the flow of the game. When I spoke with Chris McEntee, then project lead at Moon Studios on Ori & The Will Of The Wisps, he broke this process down extensively.

But Astria Ascending has none of this. Working out where you’re supposed to go is a nightmare, not helped by possibly one of gaming’s worst dungeon map screens: a bafflingly sparse paper card design that offers little to no hints to your next destinations. It’s pure guesswork, which meant that every time I ended up where I started I just wanted to throw myself out of the window.

Overall, Astria Ascending feels like a missed opportunity. Despite these issues, the game does right by its art direction and world-building, but the fundamental gameplay drags the whole experience down towards mundanity. Having to wait for the seven enemies in front of you to status lock you to death isn’t challenging and engaging combat; it’s tedious. Jumping through dungeons hoping to find a doorway that leads to the next area isn’t interesting trial-and-error exploration; it’s dreadful. In the JRPG marketplace that’s filled with all sorts of storytelling quirks and eccentricities, tedium is simply no longer acceptable.",Astria Ascending Review

7 Fun and frustrating

“For God’s sake he’s after you! Run, run!”

That’s Erin’s voice on the walkie talkie, the little kid who guides you through the hallowed hallways of Gravewood High. It’s a crystallisation of fifty years of high-school horror tropes combined with stealth game traps. This school, in particular, is stalked by Mr. Hyde, a dreadful, long limbed, hot breathed teacher who gives chase on sight. That’s not to mention the trickster ghosts, oozing mounds of eyes and the odd sense that the laws of time and space no longer apply here. Yet the main threat is still Mr. Hyde. Beware his persistent searching, his security cameras, and that menacing laugh as he wraps his arms around you.

Set in 80s or 90s America, Gravewood High is, in many ways, indebted to American horror tropes–specifically the Stephen King-like idea of a ‘place of power’. Like the Overlook Hotel from The Shining, Gravewood High looks like it has been through several eras of terror.

Your investigation within Gravewood hinges on finding friends who have gone missing there. Through tool-based, object retrieval puzzles, and stealthy evasion, you must get to where your friends have supposedly been taken: the tower, which juts out from the centre of the school, heading into the clouds.

Frustrating horrors

Getting there means surviving every puzzle without being grabbed by Mr. Hyde. This is tricky, not only due to the tendency for long sections without checkpoints, but also the paths and objects surrounding the puzzle rooms changing each time you are captured. This differentiates each attempt at getting past the demon teacher, and thankfully you will retain the keys you find on each run, even if you’re sent back to the start.

Fortunately, the puzzles are simpler than evading Hyde. For all the game’s supernatural elements, outsmarting him is mainly achieved through more analog means: you can use wrenches and bolt cutters to reveal passages for climbing and crawling around in. That is, except for the one gun that runs on void crystals, which can destroy certain walls around the school to create new routes–a hint that the school has quite literally been detached from our dimension.

Some obstacles and threats, however, are either unseen or unnecessarily loud, distorting expectations about the environment. The game overcompensates when it comes to aural obstacles, littering rooms with plant pots and rubber ducks that can’t be moved without commotion. This can cause Gravewood High’s stealth puzzle balance to feel unfair, even bordering on irritating.

Horror without context

While these happenings and the game’s classroom setting give the impression of an all-American teen horror story, similar to that of the Goosebumps horror books, Gravewood High seems to employ a more sardonic approach.

Take the game’s promotional material that quotes the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children on the number of missing children per year, while offering advice that these should be ‘handed out anywhere children are present’. The type of American horror invoked leans on conservative ideals of protecting children from corruption. Hyde is that threat, and with your unnamed character, you basically roleplay the plucky independent child who has become a modern American hero.

However, there’s little interest in delving into this beyond its superficial setting, as well as the artefacts and hints of American history that permeate this place. You’ll eventually discover that Gravewood High, for instance, used to be a Civil War fort, and was even turned into a WWII laboratory, but there’s no exploration of the implications of these histories–a lost opportunity that could imbue it with more depth.

Built atop this unexamined well of American horror culture, Gravewood High makes for a mild horror game that relies on the peril of the chase. It’s a frustrating but fun entry into the genre of ‘escape the creepy guy’ games, even if it could have been much more.",Gravewood High (Early Access) Review

8 Emotional and inviting

The mix of tones between horror-comedy and pathos won’t be for everyone, but Impostor Factory is a thoughtful change from Freebird’s previous releases. The game challenges players to consider difficult moral questions, even beyond what previous Freebird games have asked about the nature of memories and the integrity of the mind.

Impostor Factory picks up both before and after Freebird’s previous games, dividing players into two groups. The first group is those who’ve played these titles before, including To the Moon and A Bird Story. The second group, which is more interesting, is those who haven’t played these games before, since it’ll be refreshing to see how they’ll respond to the dilemmas in the tale.

However, Impostor Factory is a standalone experience, and its weighty emotio​​nal climax will especially reward returning players with a complex sci-fi plot with ties to the previous games.

Horror, emotional comedy

You start with a classic story opening: some guy just shows up. As the unfortunate fellow, Quincy arrives at a fancy party, although he appears to be dressed casually. The hosts’ staff say he’s the first guest to arrive, but he runs into fellow guest Lynri when he goes upstairs. Then things start to get bloody when he finds the hosts gruesomely murdered. Or… are they? What unfolds is a slapstick horror comedy with Quincy at its centre. He runs around the house, confronted with gory scenes that grow more elaborate, which then suddenly vanish. He even begins to suspect the household’s little cat in an imaginative scene that made me laugh out loud.

But that’s just the beginning, because Quincy learns some truths that would change his perspectives on the events around him. This is when the game picks up a familiar mechanic from To the Moon and Finding Paradise: you explore scenes from someone’s memories in order to gather orbs that let you break through to the next area. These are sometimes more interactive and, at other moments, take the form of fleeting glimpses of memories that are seen only in passing. Freebird has always excelled at nonverbal cues.

Full of details

The styling in Impostor Factory is really inviti​​ng, with art that I enjoyed more than in any of the previous games. The game’s murder mystery is set in a beautifully creepy mansion complete with ramparts and mysteriously locked rooms. And in an homage to classic horror, the mansion reveals modern secrets hidden beneath its Victorian appearance. The grounds are also richly illustrated, including a dramatic temple of Apollo folly straight out of neoclassical England. The smooth character art and animation also remind me of Secret of Mana’s lush 16-bit pixel graphics.

Freebird games have always been funny in a gentle way that doesn’t clash with the games’ tender yet challenging emotional core. In Impostor Factory, the team has taken a big swing by including full-on horror, as well as a complex meta-story involving the nature of science and time itself. And the humor is both slapstick and risky, letting players release tension as they explore the gore and mind-bending moral conundrums posed by the game’s story. The boxing cat and the sentient rice cooker are a welcome bonus.",Impostor Factory Review

5 Messy and awkward

Going into The Good Life, I knew little to nothing about the game save that it came from the mind of Hidetaka “Swery” Suehiro (Deadly Premonition, D4, The Last Blade). It had, at least on paper, all the choicest ingredients for Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride into horror-tinged absurdism; the game’s idyllic English country setting is strongly reminiscent of Edgar Wright’s Hot Fuzz, where you learn that outward perfection comes at a great cost.

That same message is somewhat present here, but in the form of a barely coherent mess. My biggest mistake was assuming that The Good Life would be a sort of spinoff to Deadly Premonition—the village name of Rainy Woods comes from the original concept game for Deadly Premonition. It is not. It is very much its own experience, albeit one that lacks a central thread, narrative anchors or smooth mechanics.

The Good Life’s photojournalist protagonist, Naomi Hayward, is a big-city dickhead sent to live in Rainy Woods to work off a massive debt to her employer. She’s rude and almost irredeemably inconsiderate—a taxing caricature of a New York City know-it-all whose recurring catchphrase is “goddamn hellhole” (I feel obliged to point out, as a former resident of NYC, that this is a common but cliched misrepresentation of its people). It’s a classic fish-out-of-water introduction that works for a little while, until you realise that you’re the one actually in hell.

Thematic avalanche

Over the course of the main questline, there were so many times I came close to almost liking The Good Life, even its silliest arcs and most idiotic mini-games. Naomi is given her own house with an ancient 90s home computer with what feels like dial-up internet. Her main goal is to investigate goings-on in the “happiest town in the world” which also somehow involves the Arthurian legend, World War II, the English Civil War, aliens, a magical half-sheep man, some light sibling incest, time travel, 16th century Hungarian serial killer Elizabeth Bathory, a hen that lays golden eggs, a rival journalist named Daniel Miller (a lobster-obsessed Bostonian who is arguably the worst depiction of a Bostonian I’ve ever seen, and I went to college there) and oh, did I mention you can turn into a dog and a cat?

Even as a player who’s up for pretty much anything, the scale of this thematic avalanche gave me immediate psychic damage, but there’s a thin, tenuous thread of nonsense humour holding it all together. On one hand the game does a solid job at hammering home the fact that Naomi—at turns derided by the townsfolk as “a halfwit” or a useful tool—is in massive debt and literally cannot leave the town until she’s paid it all off. There’s a pointed jab at the modern gig industry via the in-game social media platform, Flamingo, where she uploads her photos (there are hotwords to give you an idea of what’s popular) and gets paid per click. The game is nothing if not effective at distilling just how mechanical this new age of busywork can be. And there’s also the borderline sociopathic cost of living even in this nowhere village—20 pounds for a mushroom pie? 75 quid to use an outdoor kitchen? 10 pounds for every fast travel?—which really forces you to think about how you’re spending your meagre income.

No, bay-bee

Unsurprisingly, the silly dog and cat shapeshifting stuff makes up the most fun parts of the game. Yes, there’s all the serious debt, but as a dog you’re also tasked to piss a scent trail to help a blind man (who can also turn into a dog/cat; everyone who lives in this freak town can) find his way to the clinic. There’s a lot of peeing, digging and sniffing, and as a cat you can also trigger an incredibly janky climbing mechanic that’s almost embarrassing to watch. The game’s choice of mount isn’t a horse but a sheep, which you can tame while in dog form, and summon with a whistle, and the steering is an absolute horrorshow. There’s a deeply unsatisfying garden plot where you can grow herbs, vegetables, and flowers, as well as place garden gnomes and potted plants filched from your neighbours. And the cooking—the one system that should bring joy in any game—is such a disappointing non-event that the sheer variety of dishes and ingredients feels like a waste.

The dialogue is face-meltingly stupid and often breaks the fourth wall with flat jokes about shitty RPGs; it’s also tonally jarring where Naomi maintains her incredulous big-city douchebag persona regardless of the scenario. She has a handful of horrid barks including a rambunctiously painful “Yeah bay-bee!” shout that plays whenever you kick your shteed (sheep steed) into high gear or do anything that involves a bit of adrenaline or risk. You’ll be tasked to do things like fetch food for a grown adult man who’s too inept to feed himself, or procure a “high-tech thingy” (actual quest description) allegedly from aliens that sounds suspiciously like a Thermos flask. It’s Swery madlibs from hell and I’m not sure if the average player will be mad enough to explore the whole game world, which is alluringly huge, but chock-full of scenarios that will try your patience more than a sugar-filled toddler.

A life poorly spent

So, what is The Good Life? Am I supposed to draw a line between some kind of Platonic ideal of living, with being a carefree dog and/or cat with no responsibilities? As a human, Naomi is beset by her debt collector, cringey emails from her employer, people asking her to do chores and fetch quests, and her own deluded desire to find Rainy Woods’ hidden treasure and become a millionaire. Were there moments of enjoyment where Dog-Naomi ran free in the countryside, digging up caterpillars and relishing this quasi-open world of weirdness? Yes, but those moments are sandwiched between incoherent storylines, awkward mechanics, and a deep, gnawing curiosity at how development went down.

I love bad games. But The Good Life doesn’t fall into this category of bad-fun, it’s simply too much of a mess. Did anyone say no to anything in the course of refining the core concept of this game? Probably not. Is it even fun? I still don’t know because even after 8 to 10 hours, I feel stuck between a begrudging sense of sunk-cost fallacy and possible Stockholm syndrome as someone who also once faced ruinous debt and an unwanted move. Honestly, there’s no such thing as a good life unless you have paws, eat garbage and can pee freely in public, but you don’t need to play this game to know that.",The Good Life Review

7 Doom-esque combat

As members of a family that have dedicated their lives to hunting the mystical and the occult, you and your cousin Luridia spend a lot of time going around the world and investigating things that you probably shouldn’t be investigating. Sure, it’s tough work, but hey, it’s a living. Unfortunately, and somewhat unsurprisingly, things have gone wrong, and Luridia has fallen silent, no longer sending you the letters that they normally would. The last time you heard from them they were going to investigate a demonic pit in a nearby village.

Here is where your journey begins. You’ve decided to also venture into this place that’s definitely a bad place to be, and then also decide to yeet yourself into the aforementioned pit, hence the name, Into the Pit. As with many roguelikes, the story isn’t all that important, instead, Into the Pit is really far more about the fast-paced almost Doom-esque combat, and the incredibly striking visual style.

The visuals are hard to describe, and screenshots really don’t do them justice. Everything looks as though you’re playing a 3D pixel art game. It’s a little odd when you first boot it up, but after a few minutes your brain adjusts and you realise that it’s a really fascinating look and fits the dark world you’re running around in perfectly.

To hell and back

So, you explore the town, find out everyone’s pretty sick of having no other villagers around because they’ve all been lost in the pit, and jump on in to try and sort things out. Before you even jump into the pit, you have to dictate what the pit is going to be like. You get to use a collection of runes and keys to generate different dungeons with different challenges, and give yourself bonuses like extra health or double resource collection, but sometimes with downsides like taking extra damage. This is a fun system, as it allows you to tailor the difficulty a little bit in exchange for more or fewer resources that you can use to buy permanent upgrades.

When in the dungeons themselves, you get two attacks and one buff to start off with. You can, theoretically, take a long-range and high damage single-shot weapon for your left hand, and a machine gun shotgun effect on your right hand, if you want. This means you can tweak your starting build, and then as you go through different rooms, you unlock more buffs that might add poison or bleed to your attacks, or other minor buffs. It’s fun, but I found that the weapons often felt a bit too similar when actually using them anyway. The only real difference was often range, but even then you move so swiftly that it’s not all that important.

I like Into the Pit a fair bit. The graphical style is nice, the combat is incredibly fluid, and the mechanics there are easy to understand, but also have a noticeable effect when spawning new dungeons. However, I also found it to be a little bit too easy for the most part. The game requires a lot of runs in order to rescue more villagers and max out your character, and it doesn’t do quite enough to keep you drawn in versus other similar games.",Into The Pit Review

7 Highly replayable

If empathy towards human life is a selling point for the sorts of video games you play, then run quickly away from Despot’s Game. In this strategic auto battler, human bodies are just a number on a score sheet. Some might argue that anything war-related relegates human bodies to sentient cattle, but Despot’s Game really rides that concept through and through. A human is only as good as the improvised weapon in their hand, or the other human mouths their body can feed.

If none of that scared you away, then Konfa Games’ mix of auto-battler and roguelike might be the sort of genre kitbash that sticks with you for a while. The writing tries hard to be clever and fails as much as it succeeds, but the tactical battling, resource management, and replayability make Despot’s Game a solid single player auto battler for Teamfight Tactics fans looking for something a little less social.

Human Cattle

If you’ve played any run-based, procedurally-generated game before this one, you’ll find the format familiar. You start with an assortment of units and are tasked to traverse through a labyrinth of dangerous trials, navigating groups of deadly enemies and potentially dangerous sub objectives, and managing your upkeeps of money and food to feed your slowly growing army of hopeless humans. Between runs, you often unlock new mutations: overarching modifiers that become boons to your units in specific ways, like making their abilities fire off more often. It takes many runs and substantial accumulation of these mutations before you feel like any given run has a potential to go your way. For too long a time in the beginning, I felt like I was coasting at the whim of the random number generator, hoping that I would get a mutation useful enough to serve the units I had in my party now, and not just something I could foolishly hope to work towards later.

Parties themselves consist of humans that you recruit in specific rooms on any given floor of the deadly dungeon. Along with spending a small fee per pink fleshy war drone, you can also spend hard earned tokens on equipment to outfit them with. These weapons determine the class each human then becomes, which in turn dictates what they do in combat. Give a sword to a human, and now they’re a Fencer. Give them a bomb, and now they are a Thrower. Each has a specific role in combat, and the mixing and match of these roles is what makes the potential of each run so enticing. I spent hours trying to find ways to get the most out of specific class mix ups just to see what kind of havoc they would make on the battlefield. The results were usually mixed from a win/loss perspective, but when I succeeded, I felt brilliant (or very lucky).

Procedurally Devastated

To that point, much of the randomisation feels more oppressive than like something that can be tamed and twisted to your liking. The equipment available to buy at these little shop locations is randomised and impossible to truly predict. You’ll definitely see lower end items more often than the rare ones, but there’s no way to influence the shop to produce more of a specific type of weapon over others. This can make collecting multiple different weapons in a particular class very difficult. As in many auto battlers in this vein, having unique members of a specific unit type in your squad can unlock big bonuses for the team, but the search for some of these bonuses can feel impossible sometimes. You’re often left going after the more attainable unit bonuses often, shying away from betting big on the more unique units or classes because you often can’t afford to fail even a little bit on your journey to the exit. One bad fight could spell disaster.

The other game modes help to break this feeling up a bit. “Easy” is the same flow but enemies are a bit softer and you have more rope to experiment freely, while “Crazy” randomises everything even further, supercharging your token gain but also pitting you against endgame monsters at a whim. Game modes and starting unit parties can be unlocked by completing objectives during a run, like collecting certain amounts of a particular sort of character class or sacrificing a certain amount of humans for food. These shorter term goals really kept me going through the first several runs, as these felt far more attainable than seeing the end credits for a good long while.

I Understood That Reference !

Less entertaining is the writing. Every so often you’ll come across a room that features a dilemma requiring you to fulfill some quest or make a decision, and consistently the ones that feel like organic parts of the world—like DJ Death needing you to hunt and kill a “hater” who left his dance party early—feel funnier and more charming than hamfisted references to Harry Potter or some other pop culture. Also, why are these references even here? Is the world of Despot’s Game in a multiverse that is connected to our real world? Nothing in the game reveals or elaborates on that question, making it all feel like it’s just there for the sake of being there.

There’s also absolutely no explanation for how we even got into a scenario where humans run an apocalyptic death race against grotesque monsters. Many games like this are light on story, but a game that spends so much time referencing other fictional worlds should spend some time building their own. It may ultimately not detract from the experience Despot’s Game does well, but it is a strange distraction, nonetheless.

At its core, Despot’s Game is a solid auto battler that prizes your ability to go with the flow over your ability to manipulate the flow directly. This can lead to several hours of curious trial and error for the patient and determined tactical mind. That said, I truly wish this game didn’t feel like it was encouraging safe and samey decision making so often, but making the risks of failure far outweigh the rewards of triumph.",Despot’s Game (Early Access) Review

5 Quite redundant

Calling this an exceptional year for Nintendo Switch owners would be an understatement. Between first-party juggernauts like Metroid Dread or strong indie hits like Spiritfarer and Boomerang X, a war of the apps brewed beneath the surface. Kicking off with a humble Calculator, contenders suddenly arose to turn your Switch into a tablet. As Battle Calculator charged through the frontlines, RedDeerGames’s AAA Clock took an alternate route, offering players the clock app you never knew you needed. All I’m saying is, you better watch out.

So, you might be asking: Henry, doesn’t the Switch already have an inbuilt clock you can find on the home menu? To which I say, no further questions please. Admittedly, there’s a few differences that set them apart , beyond AAA Clock’s $9.99 standard pricing .

Unlike Nintendo’s default option, AAA Clock seeks to monopolise your time, taking up your entire screen to tell us the precise hour and minute we find ourselves in. With every 60 seconds passing, a small noise plays, informing you of this minute change.

Getting winded

But wait, there’s more! Want to choose AM/PM or 24-hour time? Great, there’s options for both. Need an alarm clock? That can be set up with ease, though you’re out of luck if you hope to change the somewhat alarming alarm tone. Tough luck! There’s also 22 clock colours players can choose from, which can complement your Joy-Cons. Unusually, AAA Clock proudly boasts “full support for OLED technology,” but it’s unclear what exactly that does. Sadly, I don’t have an OLED Switch to test this.

Now, you may be wondering: does the AAA Clock do anything I can’t already do through my smartphone or PC? Mostly no, though it looked stunning when broadcasted through my 4K 120Hz television. However, there’s one surprising addition to AAA Clock here: there’s a hidden game. There’s no name given for this title – so I shall call it “Retro Game” as the devs call it – but you’ll play as Jelly, who’s trying to stop The General from attacking the Temple of Essence.

There’s sadly not a lot to discuss here: the game’s about rescuing a mysterious artifact before The General finds it. Retro Game is a runner, and all you do is jump over enemies to get through the levels. Mistiming those jumps causes a collision, which also forces a restart. Jelly has three hearts and wields a gun, but during my repeat attempts, I could never restore health or acquire ammo to utilise these. There’s a nice Game Boy-era aesthetic here but sadly, little substance. Eventually, I gave up trying.

Clocking out

Ultimately. I can’t say I expected much from AAA Clock. It ticks off the necessary features, bringing a functional clock to the Switch with some nice cosmetic touches, but after a tedious run of the Retro Game, I’m ready to clock out. AAA Clock might be the only best clock app on Switch, but when you can rely on your phone or a physical watch, there’s just no need for this to cost US$9.99. AAA Clock is frankly redundant and for now, that’s all the time I can spare for it.",AAA Clock Review

7 Clever but without depth

It’s not often that I find myself at such a critical loss as I seem to be after completing The Plane Effect. There’s a great deal to like about the game. It does so many things really well. The low-poly visual design is gorgeous, and makes striking use of an intentionally limited colour palette. (It’s not quite accurate to say that most of the game is monochromatic, but most levels are primarily framed in either black or gray, with a single bright contrast color. That said, even “bright” isn’t always the right word, say for a level where the use of purple as the contrast color is vivid without reducing the overall dark atmosphere.)

The puzzles are clever and frequently unexpected. In a late stage where a series of window shades need to be opened to charge a grid of solar collectors, one shade refuses to open until the player collects the materials to implement a solution that’s reminiscent of the Gordian knot.

And yet, I’m not entirely sure that the game justifies the time it demands. Its willingness to embrace non sequitur in its storytelling leaves an impression of randomness rather than cohesion. While the unnamed office worker I directed was repeatedly haunted by spectres of his apparent wife and child that would appear and fade away, I was never sure what exactly he was trying to do beyond the demands of overcoming the immediate obstacle. Was he trying to escape from a Kafkaesque office environment? Was he trying to find or recover his lost family? Was he an automaton rather than a person, and if so, did that have any impact whatsoever on his status as an office drone or his connection to his apparent family?

Do these things really matter in a puzzle game, or are mood and a clever set of gears sufficient?

The whys and hows

If I come down leaning toward the negative on the second half of that question, I do have to acknowledge that “why” is a troublesome question for a lot of video games. Even as a critic I’m inclined to spend more time dealing with what is in front of me, and how exactly it does what it does, than in attempting to deal with why this particular story or system might be necessary at this particular time. (In part, because very few games can claim to be “necessary” in any meaningful sense, and because necessity is very rarely a useful limit on the existence of a cultural object.)

But even in The Plane Effect’s relatively short play time, I found myself asking why it had me spend a not-insignificant amount of time walking and driving in a straight line, simply to reach the next obstacle. Someone had to build that road, even digitally. It is an object of time and effort, and I’m not sure why it’s there. And if I’m not sure why the road is there, if I’m not sure what the destination is, then it leaves me to ask why the obstacles are there–and that’s a particularly dangerous question.

Without depth or soul

Puzzle games, maybe even a bit more than other genres, are explicitly objects of craft. Every part of a puzzle has to serve a purpose and fit together in a satisfying manner. When this is done skillfully, then it can sufficiently answer the question of “why” in and of itself. But purpose is not the same thing as meaning, and when a puzzle attempts to reach for a sense of meaning–to engage with the question of “why”–then it has to be judged by a different standard, and The Plane Effect isn’t quite successful on this level. It neither answers nor transcends the questions it seems to want to pose.

The Plane Effect is a fine and even beautiful mechanical object, but it doesn’t quite have a soul.

It is a shame perhaps, because with a bit less open space, without the spectres who are never quite made substantial, I think that the automaton might have been enough, regardless of whether or not there was a ghost in the machine.",The Plane Effect Review

8 Tactical and clever

There’s nothing quite like the admittedly verbose description of card-based tactical dungeon crawler RPG to pique my interest in a game. That’s what Gloomhaven—a videogame adaption of the popular board game of the same name—promises, and it certainly delivers, particularly on the tactical front, even as it frequently beats an unprepared player into the ground until they learn its intricate ways. But once all the pieces click into place, it makes you feel like a strategy savant.

It starts in a fairly straightforward manner, with a plodding tutorial that introduces six of the playable characters. It might be too slow for veterans of the board game. But for the uninitiated, it’s a wonderfully crafted way to teach players not only the playstyles of each character, but the importance of making good decisions. Each tutorial is designed with one solution, and failure means you’ll have to start over again, letting you know how important it is to carefully consider each move.

The moves are turn-based and carried out by playing cards. Each class possesses its own deck that’s home to a variety of distinctive abilities. The classes are the standard fantasy fare found in RPGs like tanks, healers, buffers and such, but the way the cards are used feels fresh. Every turn, or round, in a given scenario asks you to choose two cards from your characters’ deck, with each having two abilities that occupy the top and bottom half. The catch is, if you use the top ability on one card, you must use the bottom on the other, or vice versa.

Beyond that, each card has a number that determines when that character will move, with a lower digit letting them move sooner. That means you will need to carefully consider the order you want to move alongside which abilities are appropriate to use in that situation. But, much like a game of chess, you’ll want to think further than your next turn. You see, once you’ve used a card, it will be discarded or, if it boasts a powerful move, burned and become unavailable for the rest of the scenario. Discarded cards can be returned to the hand by resting, but this comes at the cost of burning another.

Always stay three steps ahead

Ultimately, you need to plan several moves ahead, considering what cards might be useful for later and which you can afford to lose. It all serves to provide a ludicrous amount of depth in each scenario, and truthfully, that’s barely scratching the surface. On top of that, you can buy gear for your characters to improve their stats, mitigate damage or deal a bit more in combat. And then there’s the RNG angle to consider.

But even when you have decided your perfect move for the next turn, it could still go horribly wrong. The enemies may draw cards that allow them to move before you, meaning your powerful bombardment no longer works because they’re no longer in the right place. Alternatively, once you’ve attacked, the modifiers that come into play could yield a x0 roll, eliminating all of your damage. By levelling up each character, you can unlock perks that lessen the danger of a low roll, but they’re always a threat.

The more you play Gloomhaven, the more layers of strategy it seems to reveal. Throw in the myriad classes, enemy types, mission variants and the potential number of tactics increases further still. You might find yourself spending just as much time selecting classes before the mission as you do in the dungeon, deciding the best combination of characters to battle against the undead or an army of overgrown vermin.

It’s a thinking person’s game that provides an unrivalled dopamine hit whenever you successfully clear a dungeon with a meticulously planned strategy. If you’ve not played the board game before, it might take a little while to master, but it’s absolutely worth the investment.

Adjustable difficulty

Mercifully, though, developer Flaming Fowl Studios has included numerous ways to tinker with the difficulty settings. Aside from the standard Easy, Normal, Hard setup, the number of characters you take into each dungeon affects the strength of the enemies. While you’re getting to grips with the game, taking in two makes everything a little less overwhelming. Then, once you’ve become accustomed with the game, you can take in a few more to explore deeper strategies and synergies between classes. It’s always great to have options that allow more players to ease into the swing of things.

Gloomhaven certainly has a few issues though. There are some missions where you have to protect or escort an AI character and they are utterly useless. They make their moves at a glacial pace and still do nothing helpful when they finally decide to act. Fortunately, they don’t appear too frequently.

Another concern relates to the exhaustion mechanic. This occurs when you’ve burned too many cards to be able to play two more. At this point, the game would ideally detect that you can no longer play any cards and simply kill your character. However, it doesn’t. Instead, it still makes you go through the rigmarole of selecting to rest and choosing something to discard first. Similarly, there are times when a simple end turn button would be helpful, but the game forces you to click through everything regardless. It’s far from a deal-breaker, but it’s a little irritating nonetheless.

At its core, Gloomhaven is a deep tactical experience that’s immensely satisfying once you get to grips with its layers upon layers of systems. It also includes multiple options to vary the difficulty, so newer players don’t feel overly punished by making mistakes, whilst strategy aficionados can dial up the challenge to match their ability.",The Indie Game Website

7 Full of paranoia

With their debut title Dap, Melting Parrot has given me a neurotic new pastime: trying to stay cool in the midst of intense, sinister weirdness. The 2D action-adventure is a haunting little gem that goes light on exposition and heavy on existential horror—a peculiar experience that deserves to stand on its own merits, far from throwaway creative comparisons to Studio Ghibli or Dark Souls.

The basics are simple: you’re a plucky little dap tasked with shepherding your fellow daps to safety through a poisoned forest bristling with danger. The game’s obscure mythology is part of its charm: there’s an ominous reaper-like entity, a deer-skull god who needs your help, and the cleansing power of fire (a quasi-Promethean touch), which staves off a mysterious zombifying disease. There are tiered planes of existence, including one where you can replant critical parts of a meta-forest with resources that you collect from the world “below.”

New daps are gathered from huge plants that resemble the parasitic rafflesia flower family, a massive species known for its distinctive rotten-meat stench that attracts pollinating insects. One might think that collecting more daps is better, but it’s a double-edged sword—more daps give you more ranged firepower, but it also means that when you enter an afflicted zone, you have to worry about more daps potentially turning into diseased, brainwormed enemies.

The daps themselves also evolved and took on new roles as I shepherded them around—for instance, I hit a lot of them by accident (which prompts them to produce a childlike “dap?”) and immediately felt bad. In turn I thought of them as helpless babies, mindless drones, and a swarmlike extension of the player-controlled dap.

Agility and paranoia

After a few hours in, gameplay settled into a practiced rhythm that rewards quick reflexes and smart timing, but it’s Dap’s compelling balance of paranoia and the atmospheric aesthetics that kept me going. Besides a feeble light radius, all I had was a vaguely peripheral sense of where my next enemies would spring from, with clues from glitchy sound effects and fleeting glimpses of ghosts. Aside from a few sections that play around with magnification/zoom and tighter frames to reduce visibility, and a few simple cut-scenes, every new stage is a variation of this base recipe.

This isn’t to say Dap is a breeze—it’s actually tough, but probably a delight for old-school Pikmin players looking for a similar vibe. Enemies hit hard, you might not be able to fire off enough ranged shots to nuke them in time, and your horde of dap followers can be pretty distracting, especially if they start to self-destruct. More than once, I became too focused on conserving my fire-building resources or crafting potions for survival, and ended up wandering around aimlessly (there’s no map or map overlay); it’s easy to get momentarily turned around after a spurt of frantic dashing and evasion.

Reflexes necessary

The Dap experience is intuitive, save for a couple of moves that were easier to immediately pull off with a gamepad instead of the keyboard. But after a few hours, things started to hit a wall—my pleasantly self-induced sense of paranoia gave way to frustration and monotony as I dashed around trying to advance the game. It all came back to the reflexes; if you’re not particularly adept at hair-trigger reflexes, getting through Dap can be frustrating, which harshes the lovely dark mood of its environment. Even while the gorgeous alien botany is alluring and forms the artistic backbone of this curious little game, I found myself wanting more options—perhaps a narrative mode for players focused on the world and its strange inhabitants—and a change of pace.",The Indie Game Website

6 Janky and flawed

When I was a kid, my uncle bought me Rome: Total War—a game I unexpectedly grew to enjoy. I had enough fun with it, spending hours conquering various lands and building up my army.

Only as an adult did I learn that it’s mostly a colonialism simulator, where you’re simply exploiting the resources of a foreign land for political and economic means. At the same time, many games are also heavy on these subtle narratives, from No Man’s Sky to even Animal Crossing: New Horizons—and most aren’t even aware of these themes they carry.

Conversely, JETT: The Far Shore’s abject awareness of these themes, and how it explicitly sought to avoid replicating features that mimic settler colonialism, is what made its premise so intriguing to me at first. When JETT was first revealed last year, the first new game from Sword & Sorcery EP’s Superbrothers in almost a decade, its gameplay trailer noted the game’s avoidance of combat or resource extraction, and how characters would go to great lengths to abstain from conflict with the indigenous wildlife.

Shadow of the Kolosi

JETT, like all games that appeal to me, began with an existential crisis. As the protagonist Mei—a “Mystic” brought on the journey to help as a guide—you embark to a place known as the far shore. The journey takes 1,000 years, a length of time which I struggle to comprehend, and as the numbers in the cutscene leading to the first chapter ticked up and up towards the final length of time, I almost found myself panicking. This really sets the stage for the characters’ circumstances, as they probably have to reconcile with the suggestion that the people they knew and loved back home would be long gone.

At the same time, this sense of scale can also be felt when you first arrive on the far shore. You and your partner, Isao, are the first to take your titular jett, the vehicle you traverse the planet with, down to the planet below. In the distance, Isao notices a kolos, a huge serpentine creature swimming in the ocean.

I was immediately captivated. This sense of awe was akin to my first encounter with a dragon in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, or one of the colossi in Shadow of the Colossus. Its sheer size and enormity made me feel so small and insignificant, emphasizing the scale of this huge, unfamiliar world.

This observation also makes another point clear: that the planet doesn’t belong to you, and you’ll be in for a challenge if you try to make it so. At points, the planet almost seems to defend itself, with certain locations sporting huge spires that send out “griefers”, alien creatures that come after you in an attempt to wreck your ship.

JANK: The Far Chore

Let’s get one thing out of the way first: a big issue I faced with JETT was the controls’ jankiness. In concept, the controls for the jett are relatively simple: you propel forward automatically while your scramjets are on, you can surge for a boost of speed, and you can “pop” (pressing the X button) in various ways—an action that, depending on the input of your left analogue stick, can result in various actions. Holding left or right and popping causes you to dodge roll in either direction, holding down allows you to perform a big jump, and just tapping the button emits a small, harmless shockwave to interact with things in the world, which you can increase in size by holding down the button.

In open spaces, the controls can feel like a dream. Zooming across the land and ocean felt incredibly liberating, much like a master jett pilot. The problem is more significant when navigating in tight spaces.

Parts of the world feature lush, gorgeous forests, which are a visual treat, but a piloting nightmare. I would find myself bumping into things so often that I have to restart my jett frequently, since it would shut down constantly, much in the same way a car might stall. Upon every instance of this would only cause my irritation to escalate, because the controls weren’t precise enough to steer through these spaces.

Untapped potential

Yet steering the jett wasn’t that much of a letdown. There were moments where flying did feel intoxicatingly fun. What left me disappointed, however, were the unfulfilled promises from that aforementioned trailer.

There are a few occasions where characters question the actions they’re taking to survive. The history of JETT’s setting is mostly vague, but you do learn about why you set off on this journey in the first place. There was a man named Tsosi, who apparently had a vision of ‘the far shore’, a place that would supposedly be their salvation. To get to this planet—a place that is implied to bring salvation to humankind—the explorers just had to follow the sounds of a radio wave known as the hymnwave.

Except upon arrival, everything is not what they thought it would be. Tor, where the hymnwave emanates from, is hostile towards the crew, sending both griefers’ and “dreadwave” towards them—antagonistic forces that will destroy both their physical health and their technology. As a result, one of your companions, Jones, found her belief in Tsosi’s prophecies wavering.

These introspective moments are few and far between though, and the game is never confident enough to answer those questions. I was curious about how it would address Jones’ doubts over what is essentially her life’s purpose, but we never did spend enough time with her again to find out if she truly sought change. Such questions also plagued Isao after a fight with a kolos, but the ending isn’t able to devote enough time to address his own moral dilemmas.

JETT’s hesitance to address their conundrums is more than just a matter of closure; it also ties in with the game’s attempts to subvert its tale’s colonialist roots. Themes of religion also permeate JETT; Tsosi, for instance, was also admired as a spiritual leader for the explorers, and Jones’ doubts are complicated by her faith in his words. It’s a game that tries to suggest that science and religion can deliver salvation for a dying species, rather than being treated as two incompatible forces. Yet in this avoidance, it doesn’t confront how religion was used to enforce colonisation–an event that definitely happened, many times over, in our own history.

Creating a game about making a home on foreign land was never going to be easy, and JETT had boldly sought to subvert the themes of colonialism that are so inherent to tales like these. But upon putting down the controller, I mostly felt let down by how little it had to say on the subject. While it touches on other topics, such as the terrifyingly big expanse of space, versus our miniscule existence in the greater scheme of things, these weren’t enough to make up for its flaws. In the end, I just wish JETT had the confidence to pursue what I know it wants to be: to subvert expectations on the well-trodden ground of survival stories.",JETT: The Far Shore Review

9 An exhilarating performance

Part of the allure of rock stardom is the allure of becoming someone else. Someone who feels more confident, more interesting, more successful than you might right now. It’s a path that allows one to subvert the expectations that have been set for you—by friends and family, by educators and employers, by your own senses of survival and doubt—and transcend the mundanity of modern life. The odds it’ll work out are infinitesimally small though, leaving countless would-be musicians wondering what could have been instead of taking the stage.

What if the script were flipped, though, and the assumption from birth is that you’d become a musical prodigy?

That’s the question at the heart of The Artful Escape, a musical narrative adventure from Australian rocker Johnny Galvatron’s game development studio Beethoven & Dinosaur (via indie imprint du jour Annapurna Interactive). It blends familiar narrative tropes of wayward youth with a unique blend of platforming and musical mechanics to produce an experience that crosses genres while staying true to nothing other than its own creative vision.



Opening for a folk legend

The Artful Escape opens in Calypso, Colorado, a tourist trap town nestled in the mountainside, where teenage singer-songwriter Francis Vendetti (voiced by actor Jason Schwartzman) is preparing for his debut concert. First shows are always a nerve-wracking experience, but even more so when you’re the nephew of a folk music legend, and your performance is part of a celebration for the anniversary of his landmark album. Between adoring townsfolk and an aggressive promoter with a bottom line to satisfy, it’s enough to make one want to disappear.

That’s exactly what happens when Francis gets warped into an alternate dimension in the middle of the night by a strange being named Zomm (who looks something like an elongated brain in a floating glass tube) where he shreds his way through a journey of self-discovery along with sarcastic stage coordinator Violetta (Lena Headey) and interstellar guitar god Lightman (Carl Weathers). This is the moment where the game shifts from feeling like a Wes Anderson-esque film to an interactive sci-fi rock album cover, trading sensible earth tones for bright neon dreamscapes. When it comes to subverting expectations, the game walks its own talk.

Performance of a lifetime

The Artful Escape weaves its way through its four to five-hour runtime with tightly written dialogue trees, breezy platforming sequences, and high-stakes shred sessions with otherworldly beings. On paper, this sounds like a bizarre mashup of mechanics that shouldn’t work together. Yet they do, somehow, creating a cohesive experience that defies much explanation but feels extremely satisfying to play (you’ve got to love any game with a dedicated button for playing sick guitar licks for no purpose other than the satisfaction of riffing while leaping through space).



There’s not much challenge to be had here, though some late-stage segments do succumb to stiff controls that aren’t quite fine-tuned enough for polished platforming, leading to a level of trial-and-error that can mildly disrupt the flow of Francis’ adventures. This is a minor criticism, however, and certainly nothing that mars the overall experience in an impactful way. While approaching The Artful Escape like a traditional side-scroller will likely lead to consternation, those willing to follow its rhythms wherever they may lead will find much to discover.



Players are not mere witnesses to the protagonist’s journey of self-discovery either. Branching dialogue trees offer a level of agency in guiding the narrative, as do interactive options to customise your appearance. The Artful Escape is at its best when it pulls the player into the story as an active participant rather than an outside observer, and in a way, perhaps inviting the player to interrogate their own internal resistances as they think through their responses to (at times) heated questioning from those trying to push Francis to live up to his potential.



By the time the final credits roll on The Artful Escape, it’s a challenge to succinctly summarise what you’ve just experienced. It’s a game without a genre, one composed of familiar elements blended in an unfamiliar way, creating something that is uniquely its own. It’s been a long time coming since The Artful Escape was given its initial glimpse of what was in store, but when it’s all said and done, it leaves the audience satisfied but still wanting just a little more. Like any good concert.",The Artful Escape Review

4 Not very engaging

I will make no bones about this: I did not like Sheltered 2 much. It sets expectations for what you’ll be dealing with, and then decides to go about it in a pandering and tedious manner. It glosses over a lot of what made me raise my eyebrow in interest during its character creation.



Sheltered 2 sees you managing a trio of post-apocalyptic survivors’ broader activities (exploring, harvesting plants and crafting), who must not only make their abandoned shelter a livable space, but deal with six other factions that are currently vying for control over the area, at the same time.



Up front, Sheltered 2’s character creation promises a game that will have you dealing with the aftermath of a world that has gone to hell. You don’t just simply place points into attributes such as strength and charisma, but manage traits that positively or negatively impact your leader—that means you also don’t get full control over the rest of your crew, and anyone else who joins you will be randomly generated personalities.

For instance, you could place all your negative traits into being poor at combat and simply focus on the conversation or maintenance. And with the way that each trait is described, they come off a lot more involved than they eventually turn out to be—the stark truth is that their differences are so minute, it hardly affects the game in any meaningful way.

Surviving is boring

The survivors automatically manage the small things themselves, with options to be more proactive about going to the toilet or feeding themselves. You’ll have them craft facilities and various items to help them get comfortable, while sending them out on scouting missions, which will help you do jobs for the other factions you’ve encountered or collect resources.



The thing is that all these busy work can be so dull. It attempts to keep you on your toes by driving tension through its slow pace and fueling uncertainty with limited resources, but it very quickly loses steam. Large swaths of the game are about waiting for things to happen—like for people to come back from exploring, crafting, or using the toilet—while major events hardly feel impactful, because it very rarely takes into account interactions between the survivors.

The various factions also suffer from the same bothersome issue. While they come off as vastly different and deep, you eventually discover that there’s rarely any difference between the all-women group, The Black Roses and the religious zealots known as The Church of Hope.

Plus, beyond the character creation, the only time any kind of interaction takes place is when you meet the members of the factions out in the wastes. Yet they too are lifeless husks and could have been far more.

Dreary post-apocalypse

It thus came as no surprise that conversations with these husks are also dry, with very little to do other than forging partnerships with factions or engaging in combat. Even then, combat is so monotonous that by the time I came to write this review, I just couldn’t care that I lost two people.

Exploration, too, might lead to random encounters, but these too are more of the same. With no real need to monitor your exploration crew between events—the game will alert you if you need to do anything—you spend a lot of time staring at the remaining survivors doing their chores until resources are refilled.

Compounding this mess is crafting, which is exponentially tedious. It’s necessary for building basic amenities like showers, but resources won’t be automatically sorted out for you, which means that you’ll need to manually pick out the resources yourself. As a result there’s also a lot of switching between the menus, if only to remind yourself what resources you’ll need to complete your task. What’s more is that the game is simply dreary to stare at, with no colour to its vision of the post-apocalypse. Shades of brown and grey can work great if the content inside is entertaining, but Sheltered 2 doesn’t have much to offer.

That’s the worst thing about Sheltered 2: that even though it replicates the modern harshness of the survival simulation genre that exploded off the back of DayZ’s popularity, it is incredibly boring. It lacks any of the nuance of its peers, such as the painful penalties that would be imposed on failures in Frostpunk, and the tightly-wound tension of Rust.

Despite Sheltered 2’s attempts to pander to this crowd, it largely fails to bring any new ideas to the table. Its mindless interactivity with its post-apocalyptic world, combined with an obtuse crafting system, has resulted in a game that is more annoying than tantalising.",Sheltered 2 Review

7.5 Unfulfilled potential

There is an inordinate number of telephones in In Sound Mind—along dingy, winding corridors, in abandoned shopping malls, and within dilapidated offices. Once every few moments they’ll ring, the voice on the other end sneering at you like an infantile school bully. “If I were you I wouldn’t go down the elevator,“ the presence taunts. Far from being unnerving, however, these calls break up the game’s taut tension and perilous thrills; I imagine the enigmatic caller rubbing their hands in anticipation the moment I pick up on their intricately scattered trail of breadcrumbs, and then frantically calling me to mock my incompetence. It’s nothing short of hilarious.

But In Sound Mind feels like a different sort of psychological horror game, in that it doesn’t strive for scares as much as it sought to involve you in the unravelling of its journey, which may be—or may not—be frightening. For the most part, it’s hardly so. Cheap scares are infrequent, and the ghastly presences that permeate its levels are more languid than antagonistic; you largely learn to navigate your surroundings with them, instead of being alarmed by their proximity.

That’s not to say that there isn’t any immediate danger, but rather that horror often isn’t the point of the game. Instead, In Sound Mind is about retracing the events that brought you here, where you’re stuck in an inescapable labyrinth of islands, alcoves and chambers. It’s about figuring out terrible truths, and it’s about revelling in sordid acts of voyeurism, as you sleuth around in search of much-needed answers.

Tapes galore

In Sound Mind begins with you waking up in the dark, dank basement of an apartment building. As you make your way up, hand-scrawled notes and other memos offer some clues to your next steps, while obstacles—like noxious, prismatic fumes leaking out of industrial-sized canisters, ridiculously durable police tapes, and miasma of inexplicable darkness—clog up narrow passageways. You’ll eventually pick up a few handy items along the way to disperse these, like a flashlight or a mirror shard that doubles up as a knife. On the surface, these seem like a typical excursion through once-unfamiliar environments like most games; the more tools you unlock, the more progress you’ll make.

The devil, however, is in the tapes strewn across the levels. These are pre-recorded sessions you had with your patients as a therapist named Desmond. Playing these back on a cassette player will transport you to morbid locations that are supposedly most intimate to the patients, but as with horror conventions, these are also warped to an ominous degree. In one chapter is a dilapidated shopping mall haunted by a spirit who can’t bear the sight of her face, with mannequins materialising—sometimes behind you—at opportune moments. Another is a lighthouse haunted by an apparition, emitting an incandescent beam of red light that could burn you. In essence, these levels are made up of a few straightforward platforming segments and some frankly interesting puzzles—one involves you fending off a poltergeist with your mirror shard, which you can only perceive through looking at the mirror like some sort of invisible Medusa. Once you’ve done with these chapters, you’ll be teleported back to the dingy apartment you started in, in search of another tape.

More sympathetic than most

It may seem uncharacteristic for horror games, but this soon becomes a comfortable routine for In Sound Mind. Exploration of these tapes serves as introspective exercises for Desmond, as he reflects on his past conversations with his patients, which sets the tone for the game’s discussion of mental illness. Rather than being outright demonised as unknowable, defective boogeymen, the patients are treated by Desmond with empathy. This stands as a bit of a contrast from In Sound Mind’s own promotional materials, which wax lyrical a lot about the unsettling terror of being trapped in your own mind, as it appears to embrace horror’s most harmful tendencies about mental health stigma. The distinct lack of a sanity meter—like that of Amnesia: The Dark Descent—is also a welcomed change, nor does Desmond suffer from the visible signs of duress that plague so many other horror games, such as cloudy vision and spooky hallucinations.

That’s not to say that In Sound Mind does everything right. The sneering presence on the other end of the line is wont to sprout some ableist lines—but you should just ignore the damn calls, anyway—and ultimately, the game’s most imminent threats are still the physical manifestations of mental trauma. In Sound Mind tries to foreground some of its spooks on surviving these dangers, which retreads well-worn horror grounds. It’s a bit disappointing to see that In Sound Mind doesn’t quite transcend outdated horror tropes, even though it has the potential to. But that doesn’t take away from the accomplishments that make it more intriguing than many contemporary titles: its thought-provoking puzzles, and its attempts to tell an engaging story without unnecessarily scaring you to death first.",In Sound Mind Review

6.5 enjoyable but convoluted

Unsighted is a difficult game to neatly compartmentalise. Studio Pixel Punk’s cyberpunk post-apocalyptic tale of human brutality and the fragility of existence is lost amongst an ever-expanding list of gameplay systems.

At times, Unsighted wants to be a frenetic hack ‘n slash blending various weapon and movement choices with parries and critical hits. Other times, it’s a Metroidvania filled with hidden, inaccessible pathways, until a specific power-up is found in a puzzle-filled, Zelda-like dungeon. Then there are its terminals that allow players to rest, but will revive enemies for that souls-like flavour. Adding to this mayhem is a complex crafting system, consisting of both free-style crafting as well as blueprints; a temporary buff system; and a permanent upgrade chip mechanic—and Unsighted becomes a veritable who’s who of the gameplay fashions from the last five years.

But in trying to do everything competently, Unsighted loses sight of what makes its beautiful pixel art world worth diving into in the first place.

Committing genocide

As an automaton called Alma, you’re tasked with saving the automaton community, who were violently cast out by their human creators. To do this, Alma needs to collect five gems from across the map to form a weapon that will help unlock the meteoric power hidden away by humanity. The story itself has been told many times in pop culture—humanity builds robots, robots ask if they dream of electric sheep, and humanity subsequently hit the genocide button in panic. What makes this story stand out, other than the diverse cast of characters, is in the particular flavour of genocide the game employs.

Rather than simply destroying the automatons, humanity locks away their power to achieve sentience, leading them to slowly become “unsighted”—devoid of their personalities, thus regressing to their baser need to kill and survive. Unsighted’s snappy and diverse combat mostly revolves around smashing the “Unsighted” to destruction, which adds a curious twist to conflict that should have been explored further.

When out in the wild, wrecking these unfortunate souls is necessary for survival and for crafting better weapons and resources. But seeing fellow automatons who haven’t succumbed to the same fate as the Unsighted, as they teach you how to survive in the world, sell you items or share their personal struggles, does put into perspective their struggles: the Unsighted were once amiable beings with families and friends. Unfortunately, the crafting materials you get by destroying the Unsighted mitigates any guilt or introspection, reducing them to mere mines for resources. After all, that spring could be useful eventually.

Time constraints

Within the game lies its most compelling feature: the countdown mechanic. Each character you meet, from the Navi-inspired fairy-bot Iris to wholesome chip merchant Samuel, has a countdown clock that signifies the hours left in their life-cycle. Think 2011’s In Time starring Justin Timberlake or the music video to Savin’ Me by Nickelback (a truly cursed combination). It’s this countdown that gives Unsighted an unnerving sense of dread, and an interesting incentive to plough through the game as quickly as possible, to save as many people as you can. However, this time limit is at odds with many activities the game wants you to partake in, such as exploring secrets, finding unique weapons and fishing for crafting materials. This subsequently makes those systems feel shoehorned in, rather than an integral part of what makes Unsighted’s cogs turn.

Had it been stripped away of some of its convoluted system, and instead focused on one or two features and story beats to go alongside its high level of polish and presentation, Unsighted would be a GOTY contender. But in trying desperately to be everything, Unsighted loses sight of the aspects that make it unique in an ever-expanding marketplace of retro-inspired Mentroidvanias. As a result, it’s an enjoyable, but ultimately forgettable experience.",The Indie Game Website

6 Rough but promising

Normally I’d start with a brief synopsis of the game’s characters, story, and central conflict, but Blake: The Visual Novel has left me struggling to summarise it all, because so much of the visual novel feels like loosely connected strands of plot or character exposition with little follow-through or fleshing out.

I can safely say the game focuses on our titular character, Blake, muddling through an increasingly confusing and bloody part of his life, but beyond that it’s a bit messy. The story begins with Blake standing on the edge of a rooftop, waking up from a dream, and then going to work. Then he gets to the office and finds out that the boss wants to have him work on a secret pseudo-VPN project, suggesting that the game might be delving into a tech-gone-wrong storyline.

But then there’s a sudden revelation about Blake’s family, a max security prison reality show, a kidnapping, and so many other twists and turns that eventually it becomes impossible to really define Blake: The Visual Novel, and I do not mean that in a positive way.

Hit and run

My first run took 74 minutes, and left me with the distinct impression that the story would have been better told over the course of five to six hours. The game has so many interesting plotlines and worldbuilding tidbits that ultimately aren’t expanded on meaningfully, leaving me confused as to their inclusion at all. For example, there’s a coworker of Blake’s whose father is one of the criminals on the murder show. This coworker tells Blake he watches the programme specifically to see his dad, because he only gets to visit every six months. What I have typed above is the full extent to which the visual novel delves into this particular piece of Blake lore on my run.

There’s another scene where a ditzy character archetype disarms a hardened murderer and then straight up explains nothing about where she picked up her combat skills or how she ended up working at a tech company instead of, say, private security. Sexy androids are a thing, and they will serve you banana bread at your favourite after-work bar.

Blake: The Visual Novel is replete with moments such as these, where the writer dangles tantalising bits of deeper characterisation or lore about the futuristic society of New Stone that ultimately go nowhere. By and large they’re left forgotten as I scurry along to the next chunk of story, not unlike frantically racing along in a tour group wherein the guide is bound and determined to share the entire history of Rome with you in under two hours.

Doing too much

I also had issues with sudden tonal shifts and condensed, abrupt narration, such as when Blake and his father are talking and the conversation immediately pivots from, “Yeah, your mom disappeared on a drive home one day and probably got abducted and murdered,” to looking at pictures of Blake as a child and laughing at his bad outfits together. It’s possible to do such scenes well if you spend time fleshing it out–maybe with the pictures framed as a sudden change of subject and the laughter coming on gradually as they mentally exit a sombre revelation–but that’s not what happens here. Scenes are rapid-fire and hopscotch from one to the next, strongly implying a lot of bonding and plot developments are happening offscreen. They devote more time describing, say, the ancient technology of tree-based paper than showing Blake and his father bonding. Incidentally, I find the implication that paper is some sort of scarce material very odd, when this is followed by a scene in a murder garage with paper posters, paper on the floor, and paper stacked in boxes five feet high.

To be clear, I didn’t hate Blake: The Visual Novel, or even dislike it. The art is beautiful (albeit even with a gun to my head, I could not tell you what the dress code in the ICC office is), and the music was delightful from start to finish. I was sincerely interested in where the story was going once I got through the dense, front-loaded exposition. Plus, Blake himself was awkward and sad enough to be endearing.

But so many elements of the visual novel were included only superficially, so few characters were given proper development, and so many loose ends were left dangling that I ended up feeling rather disappointed at the end. It needed an editor who was prepared to either murder half the writer’s darlings, or hold them at knifepoint until a more fleshed-out narrative could prove they were worthy of inclusion.

You can tell beautiful stories in under 90 minutes, and you can have incredibly complex psychological thrillers in futuristic dystopias, but it’s difficult to execute both of these at once in visual novels without another trained set of eyes combing over the story. I will acknowledge that some of these might be better explained in more detail had I went back and made different choices, but without hooking the reader on their first readthrough, they won’t be going back for subsequent rounds to seek answers to all their questions; I, for one, am not rushing back to see what I missed.

Even so, Blake: The Visual Novel was a promising debut from Ori Mees; Blake made me laugh a few times, and stressed me out over making the right decisions at other points. I felt compelled to read it through to the end, which is more than I can say for other visual novels I’ve muddled through recently. Even though Blake definitely displays the tell-tale, first-project symptom of doing too much in too little time, it has definitely convinced me to keep an eye on the developer’s future projects.",Blake: The Visual Novel Review

8 Fun and satisfying

In the roguelike genre, deck-builders are usually prevalent, so seeing action-based RPGs like Returnal and Hades rise to the top make for a refreshing change of pace. While Arboria doesn’t quite reach the heights of these titles, it is still a fun 3D action roguelike with great combat and some smart ideas up its sleeve.

In the game you play as a troll known as a Yotun (no affiliation to the Norse giants) tasked with entering an overgrown labyrinth, to find a way to heal Father Tree’s roots and save your village.

You see, Father Tree is infected with a mysterious affliction, so you must delve into the dungeon, as you fight enemies, collect a valuable resource named Veri, and get stronger and stronger until you eventually meet a foe you can’t overcome. When this happens, your weird Troll-fairy companion rips off your head and takes it back to the surface. A new Yotun is made, and the cycle begins all over again.

Loads of leafy greens

What sets Arboria apart is its biology-based aesthetic. The Troll world is overgrown with all sorts of fungi and foliage, and the Yotun are also made from this same bio-matter. This means that it’s no trouble for Father Tree to grow another Yotun when you die, sending you right back into the labyrinth. There’s also a variety of high-tech machinery scattered around, implying that some previous civilization somehow caused Arboria’s accelerated growth and these sentient plant people.

This focus on biology extends to the game’s mechanics as well, with symbiotic weapons and bio-mutations. As you fight your way through the procedurally generated dungeon of Durnar, you’ll pick up weapons you can combine with other elements, allowing you to mutate them, and change what they do. You might turn your regular old launcher into one that sprays poison, or imbue your Yotun axe with darkness. This is one of the game’s primary roguelike elements, as you create ever more powerful combinations to overcome the dungeon’s trials.

The second of these aspects involves the safe room between floors. If you survive a stage in the dungeon, you get a short break in a safe room alongside a lore entry, as well as the ability to choose from one of three possible mods that enhance your character, in a similar way to Hades. This is another way you can stack multiple effects alongside those weapons and mutations. At the same time, you can use this room to send your valuable Veri back to the surface, which serves an important purpose later.

When you do finally get killed, a chunk of Veri goes to the gods, who look on you with favour depending on how good your run was. But you can also increase this favour by giving them more of the Veri you harvested. Favour is valuable since it determines the traits you get when choosing your character from the next crop of Yotun. Essentially, the happier the gods are, the better your next starting character is. You’ve also got to be careful with giving them too much, since you also need Veri to purchase upgrades in the Troll village. It’s a smart system that allows you to optimise your character and effects right from the outset by choosing a Yotun with favorable traits.

Trying too hard

Yet, while I really like Arboria’s weird biomechanical setting, I didn’t enjoy its characters so much. It’s obvious that the game is trying to be funny with its wise-cracking fairy companion and oddball trolls, but it missed the mark. Fortunately, story isn’t as much of a concern in an action roguelike as say, combat, and Arboria’s hack ‘n slash weapon-play is extremely satisfying. Every weapon has its own unique moveset that feels impactful, and the dodging is great as you evade and counter enemy attacks and whack them back.

On the whole, Arboria is a fun spin on the largely established roguelike formula, using its overgrown dark and dank setting to create a series of inventive mechanics, which means that no two runs are ever the same.",The Indie Game Website

8 Wonderfully striking

The lightning farmers are one of the stranger tribes in the wasteland. Tall and hunched on dual walking canes, they spend their days marching up a mountain and harvesting crystals that form briefly after strikes from a controlled storm. It used to be carried out by giant robots that suddenly ceased to work. It makes me second guess if the monuments I’ve encountered across the desert weren’t other frozen sentinels.

The farmers aren’t chatty, but their leader is willing to share some kind words with Sable, a young woman performing a pilgrimage known as ‘the Gliding’.

Sable attempts diplomacy when the farmer asks if she finds them weird. Sable says she’s seen weirder. The farmer tells Sable she doesn’t have to be so polite.

Wherever Sable goes, strangers are gentle. They seem to see some light in her. Many had been her before. Sometimes the Gliding feels like a Bar Mitzvah, as Sable studies the history of the desert, alien ruins, fallen spacecraft, and her place within it. Sometimes the Gliding feels like an internship, as she helps shopkeepers and mechanics round up spare parts and beetle dung. It’s not clear how far down the line this civilisation is from the cataclysm that left them scattered across the desert. Humanity doesn’t seem to be on the ropes, but many sandstone villages have been abandoned, boarded up and buried in rubble.

Sending their young into the great wide open on a nuclear powered hoverbike may seem like a strange habit for the remnants of humanity. Yet Sable–the game–makes it clear, with civilisation scattered to the winds, that such rituals serve a purpose. It keeps these outposts connected, at the very least reminding each settlement there’s still others out there. It lets young adults see what the world still has to offer them. And that’s what you will be doing as Sable.

On your own path. At your own pace.

Starwatcher

Some dorks took umbrage that small London studio Shedworks were quicker to namecheck Studio Ghibli as an inspiration to their debut game, Sable, ahead of a more obvious one. I can’t blame them. Lots of young people know little beyond the Netflix library, never mind a cult French fantasy illustrator. At worst, this influence is just a leapfrog.

Jean Giraud, better known as Moebius, left a wake of iterations. His most iconic character, the 1975 poker faced nomad Arzach who glided across the desert atop a stone bird, inspired Hayao Miyazaki to create Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. A founding artist behind the comics anthology Metal Hurlant (or otherwise known as Heavy Metal stateside), Moebius has left tracks on everything from Alien to The Legend of Zelda. While he crossed many styles and genres, his pen is uncanny. His level of detail and unruly creatures felt like an artist who could transcribe a one-to-one translation of the images in his head. On top of Arzach’s desert soaring adventures, Sable seems most taken by Moebius’ more ligne claire works: precise on simple line work, drunk on faded cocktail color gradients. Sable’s opening scene bears a striking resemblance to a print from 2001’s Mystere Montrouge.

Making an interactive facsimile of Moebius’ style is a daunting task. While it isn’t always a slam dunk, Sable provides handsome eye candy, encouraging you to climb mountains for the view alone. The anticipated score from Japanese Breakfast is even more versatile, stringing the wasteland with theremin, accordions, shoegaze and desert psych. It’s a shame that the initial glider sounds like loose change in a dryer, so I encourage players strictly seeking to vibe to trade up for better parts as soon as they can.

When I learned that Sable was going to forego combat, my heart winced. It’s not that I’ve got a bloodthirst as much as it affirmed that Sable wouldn’t be the Arzach experience I always imagined (punting a troll in the nuts and zipping away). It may push the dream game further down the line, but disallowing iterations of Moebius would rob us of so much. Instead, it’s more important to see what Sable does with these foundations.

Desire Paths

Sable is a Breath of the Wild that’s benefitted from playing Breath of the Wild. For every intended route Nintendo baked into their open world epic, speedrunners and ding dongs alike bullishly muscled their own path: cheesing up a cliffside like a mountain goat, or spending an extra 20 minutes trying to clear a wall the dumb, futile way. It feels like Shedworks played Zelda in that fashion, making Sable with that in mind.

Inklings and unlikely looking paths often expose entire new methods of tackling tasks and temples. Where combat helped smooth out Breath of the Wild’s pacing, Sable retains momentum by constantly rewarding your curiosity. Useful items and new secrets seem comfortably nestled across the map. A more generous-than-usual ability to hover encourages you to really test Sable’s abilities, climb every vantage and dive in every grotto.

Stumbling across new outposts and nomads creates an ongoing net of tasks to do. Some are as simple as fetch quests or driving through rings, while others are investigating black market conspiracies or taking up the mantle of an urban legend. While Sable is only able to climb, float, drive and talk, quests that take the form of puzzles, exploration and mystery solving rarely makes it feel like the game is cannibalising your time. Some of the more ambitious obstacle courses, however, do seem to overlook technical hiccups and clipping issues, which, while rendering some platforming moments tedious, are otherwise negligible through the bulk of the game.

Sable’s task is to collect masks, which are exchanged for medals you gather, which reflect the peoples and secrets you’ve prioritised. That’s the task. The purpose of Sable is a pilgrimage that you have to mould to your own likeness.

8.5 Exudes charm

Black Book’s premise alone may be a make or break prospect to many. Hearing the words ‘Slavic deck-building RPG’ mashed together is bound to raise some eyebrows, but even to those who instinctively turn their heads away from card games, Black Book promises an enthralling card-building .

The game sees you playing as young Vasilisa–a practising witch who threw her fate away to marry her true love until their mysterious death–who searches for the elusive Black Book that is said to grant any wish to those who uncover all its seven seals. She becomes an infamous beacon of hope for the dreary rural countryside of Russia, solving various paranormal problems that perpetually plague the locale.

The core gameplay elements are relatively simple, but becomes more complex as you begin to learn the in-depth power that Vasilia’s enchantment book holds. Combat consists of a turn-based deck-building formula, with each card having a heal, attack, or defence ability. You start with a set of cards, with more given to you as each turn transpires.



The amount of abilities that you are allowed to use at one time depends on both level and card class, which consists of either scrolls or swords. For instance, you may have three open slots for cards, but two of those slots might be a scroll while the other is a sword classification. This means you’re limited to only a selection of cards at a time, and thus couldn’t spam your attacks.

Card fighting

Combat experience is also simplistic enough to minimise frustration, while allowing for some extremely deadly combos once players have mastered the gameplay. The difficulty slope is also perfectly attuned to even the most novice of players, as there’s plenty of room for error and experimentation within the first few fights.

Then there’s an engrossing array of minigames and random side quests that litter the Russian landscape. What is most prominent is the light detective work within the dialogue trees, where Vasilisa must deduce whether certain characters are telling the truth through information gained earlier in the story. It’s a great way to keep you on your toes, while lending credence to your deductions.

All of this culminates in an incredibly pleasing aesthetic with enthralling characters and stories. From Vasilisa to the foes and folks she meets along the way, it’s clear every ounce of passion and creativity were put into both their design and their voice acting which is well-done, despite being a bit too boisterous at times. Every inch of this captivating world will mesmerise you as it introduces vibrance and life, even through its bleak, dreary setting.

Even the music fits the atmosphere perfectly. It’s not exactly going to win any awards, but it’s a fitting one. Battle music has that upbeat, jaunty eminence, whereas dialogue opts for more inquisitive, slower beats. It sets the mood brilliantly without overshadowing its battles.

Too much to do

Although the minigames feel fleshed out, the sheer amount of things to do in them can become rather disorienting at times, especially in the first hour or so. Rather than dole information out in small doses, the tutorials in Black Book feel like they’re trying to unload everything onto you as much as possible, which can feel daunting, as though they’re used to pad more content in between the game’s core deck-fighting elements. Fortunately it’s a feeling that fades soon after the first section is over, but can be noticeably frustrating, especially since it arises so early in the game.

In the end, Black Book is one game that feels like a great representation of its genre for the uninitiated. It’s a game that exudes charm, despite the depressing landscape it’s set in. Its premise is a perfect match for novice deck-builders, as it creates a solid foundation of understanding for those looking to break into similar experiences.",Black Book Review

8 Full of heart

By now, you’ve probably heard that Eastward, the new action-adventure from Pixpil Studio in Shanghai, follows in the hallowed steps of The Legend of Zelda and cult game EarthBound (aka Mother 2). You’ll find no mind-melting mechanical or narrative reinventions here, but a meticulously-made, lovingly detailed game that is, quite simply, a real joy to play.

Playing as silent beardo John and his sort-of-foster kid Sam, you’re unceremoniously booted out of a poor, subterranean mining outpost into the unknown world above. Eastward hits all the right notes with a winning combo of sci-fi, mystery, and good old-fashioned interpersonal drama that fuels the smalltown settings where John and Sam pass through. There’s a nice balance between blessedly short cutscenes and action sections that follow a tried-and-tested Zelda formula: complete missions for NPCs, upgrade weapons and special abilities, and amass more hearts.

Most of the time, combat involves going ham with John’s frying pan—the default starting weapon that he also uses to make dinner for Sam and eventually with Sam’s energy-based abilities that help with puzzles (but honestly aren’t often required). These aren’t tough; think triggering weighted blocks, dragging and rearranging obstacles, and occasional sequences where John and Sam are separated and must use their respective abilities to help each other through the level. Nothing about combat is particularly difficult, but depending on your propensity for brute-force button-mashing, certain fight mechanics related to timing or positioning can be challenging. The escape gauntlet from Greenberg, for instance, isn’t especially tough, but a matter of nailing a good rhythmic pace as you evade the encroaching miasma.

Hack, slash and more

Eastward is generous beyond the average hack-and-slash dungeon experience—there are a whole bunch of mini-games, including a slot-machine mechanic for John’s cooking skill and a turn-based 8-bit RPG called Earth Born (hello, EarthBound) that’s clearly a widespread classic. As a game-within-a-game, Earth Born’s gacha-like system with collectible “Pixballs” sheds some light on the economy of the world—Sam is initially too poor to play because she doesn’t have her own memory card, and over time, collects enough tokens to buy Pixballs that help in battle. Little bits of flavour text, for the most part, add texture to a world already brimming over with visual details—my favourites were the rambling snippets of dialogue from each fridge which acts as a save point.

Sam’s infectious enthusiasm often bubbles to the surface with equal doses of naivete (she is, after all, a kid) which played well off my occasional frustration with the game’s wide-eyed approach to altruism. Perhaps if I hadn’t started playing Eastward at a particularly trying time in my life, I’d actually take a page or two from all of this blunt-force positivity. There’s a fair bit of painfully earnest, hackneyed dialogue that more often than not dribbles off into tedium, and some questionable characterisation choices that, in retrospect, I’d cautiously put down to cultural humor; the treatment of Greenberg’s top bachelorette Uva, in particular, seems like a vestige of outdated but “well-meaning” Chinese traditions that deepen generational divides between real-life communities. The small brothel subplot of the game in New Dam City aspired to big Stephen Chow energy—a slapstick approach that fell somewhat flat in execution, as did the vehemently man-hating stereotype of John and Sam’s neighbor in Potcrock Isle.

Familiar grounds

There are quite a few fetch quests that ping-pong across the map. Occasionally the game throws you a bone and cuts to a fast-travel sequence, but the environments are generally so beautifully rendered and animated that I didn’t mind the extra walking. Long-windedness aside, Eastward is full of heart, exuding the kind of emotional authenticity that can momentarily transport you back to the best memories of your favourite childhood RPG. I’m not the first to admire its gorgeous artwork and amazing chiptune score (composed by Joel Corelitz, who also worked on Death Stranding, Gorogoa, and Halo Infinite) and I won’t be the last—the latter is like mainlining nostalgia-laced serotonin straight to the brain.

Perhaps Eastward’s greatest strength is that it isn’t complicated—gameplay is at once deeply warm and familiar without fading into stale territory, which is surprisingly tricky for a game that presents itself as a spiritual successor to the Zelda legacy. Eastward in motion is an unstoppable force, an exquisitely-animated homage to old-school RPGs that more than compensates for its writing and narrative.",The Indie Game Website

6 Misplaced potential

Is it any wonder that mysteries seem to fit video games so well? The detective game is a convenient framework to do what the medium has conditioned us to do, often regardless of genre or subject matter: go over each environment with a fine-tooth comb, only now we rifle through drawers in hopes of finding some crucial evidence rather than a collectible or a stray healing potion. In the best detective games, we feel smart; we feel like we’ve forged our own path to the truth rather than just followed instructions until it was time for the answer to appear.

Gamedec has a very long way to go before it could be counted among the best of its contemporaries, but parts of it get close enough to leave me genuinely disappointed in the whole. You play a cyberpunk detective in the strictly virtual sense, someone who enters full-dive VR games that are elaborate enough to function like a second reality. Gamedec has no traditional combat system, hewing to the style of top-down adventure-RPG most recently and popularly seen in Disco Elysium; it’s just you, the other characters, and the environments that range from in-game to out-of-game (as well as, eventually, the question of which is which).

In Gamedec’s futuristic Warsaw City, advances in game technology have upped the stakes for their players—there’s money to be made and pills to take in order to stave off the needs of your pesky physical form. The first case, for example, involves tracking down a boy who has been logged in for days, his body present but his mind lost in some mystery game and unable to be forced offline because pulling the plug would risk a coma or even death. It’s a respectable approach to the now-tired glut of cyberpunk cityscapes, incorporating sights like the floating islands of a wooded fantasy realm, the farms of a sleepy Old West town, and the grungy back alleys of an adults-only sex-and-violence sim (extremely tame, so don’t get too excited).

Sleuthing in a virtual world

Like any good detective game, you have swaths of potential clues and data to sift through and draw different conclusions from, some totally useless and some outright red herrings. The paths through a case can differ widely depending on where you choose to focus and what decisions you make, sometimes letting you bypass rather involved scenarios altogether. But every step of the way, I found myself fighting Gamedec’s appalling interface, which smothers so many of its better ideas in technical issues or an ambition that, while admirable, it typically cannot deliver.

The codex is perhaps the worst of it, an abject nightmare to page through. The information is broken up into five categories, with one showing a series of character portraits and the other four broken into text categories like “organizations” and “reality.” Rather than simply hosting the game’s flavour text or explanations of the sometimes-arcane terminology, the codex also nests each crucial document under whatever seems to be the appropriate topic, which might be further broken up into sub-sub-categories like “gossip” and “darknet” as though this sorting method is anything but a migraine waiting to happen. If you’re not in the habit of checking every single data notification, using the codex at all becomes an outrageous guessing game, and only after you’ve managed to track a document through the maddening soup of menu options will you learn if it’s actually useful.

The deduction screen is a little better—as you talk to characters and collect information, clues fill in around a multiple-choice question like, say, which username belongs to the person you’re tracking down. Oddly, though, a deduction irreversibly commits you to a train of thought. You’ll unlock actions and dialogue options in order to continue the investigation, and there’s no changing your mind—when you decide which of two groups has witnessed a scene, you’re not able to ask about the other one at all, even if later evidence begins to contradict your assessment.

On some level, this restriction communicates the danger of making decisions based on incomplete information, but you’re often missing pieces even if you’ve investigated thoroughly because some clues are locked to specific character builds; there’s simply no way to tell when you have all you need except to run around the map before every decision and make sure there are no new dialogue options (which I very quickly gave up trying to do).

Poor detective work

The narrative does tend to complicate stories that initially seem morally straightforward, so the story will continue regardless of whether you’ve got the “wrong” idea and you’re never (intentionally) locked into a fail state. But the openness of so many great mystery games is meant to reflect the fluidity of our thought processes, the way we must constantly reckon with new information that can change our understanding. Gamedec feels more like a simulation of stubbornly jumping to conclusions—combined with the sheer disarray of the codex, it portrays a detective who sucks at their job.

In theory, the game’s reactivity is at least impressive. How you respond and what actions you take feed back into a personality system, which doles out a point for one of four “aspects” like intelligence or inspiration that you then spend on the “profession” menu (read: skill tree) to unlock certain contextual interactions. (Hacking, as you might imagine, is quite handy.) However, as much as this system adds weight to even the most inconsequential dialogue choices, it also restricts the process of role-playing—each node on the rather small skill tree requires a combination of multiple personality aspects, so that even the red, hot-headed aspect might be necessary for a certain analytical skill. What this means, essentially, is that sticking to a consistent characterisation will only hinder your progression, netting you one specific personality aspect over and over again. In practice, you’re less playing a role than guessing how the developers have weighted the dialogue options and tailoring your responses in hopes of reaching the next skill that caught your eye.

There are more general problems, too—I ran into multiple instances of quest actions failing to trigger, and characters would sometimes refer to decisions I hadn’t chosen or give information on people I hadn’t met yet. But I do find myself stuck on the idea of Gamedec’s potential; even if we ignore the few moments where the systems neatly and intentionally coalesce, there’s a particularly resonant depiction of existential despair at work. The VR focus allows for a portrayal of human ennui and general hopelessness on a large scale; here is a whole subculture of people running from an unfavorable reality, hoping to eke out a marginally better virtual existence even if the only way to access it is to buy the equipment and pay for a subscription. It’s a good setting that I would be curious to see more of, even if Gamedec’s initial exploration of it stumbles out of the gate and comes alarmingly close to a total faceplant.",The Indie Game Website

7 Exhilarating in its grind

Dream Cycle verges on the earlier, lofty promises of the much maligned space survival game No Man’s Sky; it boasts of an infinite adventure, stating that “new realms will become available” with regular updates, along with “new biomes, additional story chapters, weapons, enemies, skills and powers”. And even in its nascent Early Access state, where your dream-traversing adventures are limited to just a single location, there are already 10,000 uncharted levels to explore and objectives to overcome. So while it’s not 18 quintillion levels large—at least not just yet—the vast immensity of Dream Cycle’s layered worlds are still tinged with crushing majesty and the wonder of seemingly endless possibilities.

In some ways, Dream Cycle does deliver on this promise. You’re an arcane apprentice called Morgan Carter, who is trapped in the endless dreamscapes of Dream Cycle when a long-lost relative stole your powers and left you on the brink of death. From here you must track down your great great granduncle, Randolph Carter, and foil his dastardly plans. That said, you’ll first begin with regaining your mystical powers and recalibrating your combat skills, since enemies such as corrupt pagans and monstrous goblins roam the dreamscape you now traverse.

But hold on; this is an in-depth system that needs some getting accustomed to. You are armed with a sword for good ol’ fashioned stabbing and slashing, as well as a ranged weapon as your secondary armament—from a stealthier shortbow to a longer-ranged sniper rifle. There are also opportunities to stun your enemies with an appropriately timed kick, as well as a dodge ability that slows everyone else down around you for a brief moment. Both will reveal to you an enemy’s most vulnerable spot with a red glow, which is an area you can then strike at for critical damage. It’s a neat riff on the concept of nailing headshots in first-person shooters, and which forces you to bid your time into making more deliberate and opportune attacks.

Then there’s the stealth attacks you can perform, where you’ll creep, leap and sink your blade into your enemies’ sinewy flesh from a distance or a great height—a satisfying and effective approach to a clean assassination. And if all these aren’t enough, you’ll wield magic spells too, from tossing lightning balls to transforming into a flock of raven. Such skirmishes, when carried out to the right rhythm and gait, can be surprisingly potent and crisp.

Intense bouts of combat

But perhaps because you’re technically on the verge of death, these fights can also feel particularly challenging. Pulling off the right moves in combat isn’t easy, particularly at the start where you’re mostly a hapless soul swinging a disintegrating, rusty sword at your opponents. Throw more than one enemy into the mix, and you’ll be flinching and recoiling from attacks more often than you’d prefer. One trick you’ll have to pick up, then, is to either perform as many assassinations as you can, or lean into the axiom of “practice makes perfect”—and immerse yourself in the tedium of the grind.

The good news is that you’ll eventually get better at combat, since you’ll have around 10,000 available levels to tread through and perfect your skills. This isn’t always as awful as it sounds: the payoff is the exhilarating satisfaction that comes with finally inching one step closer towards nailing the cadence of combat, which is admittedly pretty darn thrilling at times. Launching yourself towards the unsuspecting pagan, with their backs turned to you, will send waves of dopamine down your spine.

The bad news is well, the grind. It seems that the crux of Dream Cycle, or at least in its Early Access state, is to carve a beeline towards your next objective or destination on a map—and that translates to mowing through every single pixel on that path. That’s right; every tile on the journey you’re blazing through is a level with an objective to complete, be it eviscerating all the enemies in the vicinity or destroying an illusive entity known as the eidolon, which you can draw out by killing more enemies, or triggering a sequence that will reveal a wee snippet of the universe’s tantalising lore to you through ambiguous quotes, whispered to you in deep, hushed tones. But it’s not just a series of adrenaline-fueled encounters; most times you’ll also be scaling boulders, rocks, and rickety wooden stairs erected on the edges of mountains.

More to experience

All these clambering can translate into a real sense of adventuring and peril, but can feel empty over time, like Skyrim’s radiant quests that are used to pad in more content or justify its long playtime This is especially when the progress in Dream Cycle feels delayed, with its payoff usually some pittance of gold, another rusty sword, or potions you can’t have too much of, since there’s a limit of the amount you can hold. Dream Cycle is a very intense grind, and your relationship with repetition is how much you’ll get out of going through these motions of climbing, stealthing and combat.

But perhaps there’s more to Dream Cycle’s reverie of an infinite adventure. Subsequent updates will probably see more locations, aside from its current expanse of wilderness and forests, and hopefully a greater variety of quests that involves more than just murdering pagans and hiking from waypoint to waypoint. In spite of the grind, the crux of Dream Cycle—its combat, tale and exploration—is still a meaty one. Yet paradoxically enough, I kinda wish there was more to experience.",Dream Cycle (Early Access) Review

8 Blown away, literally

Severed Steel is one of those games that starts off feeling like a power fantasy, wall-runs straight into being an exercise in being stressed and terrified, and then slides across the floor back into more power fantasies. It’s a game that absolutely demands that you get on its level, and until you embrace the carnage you’re capable of, it’ll beat you around the face until you’re black and blue.

The set-up is simple, you’ve got stuff to do, people want to shoot at you, and your main aim is to shoot them first. It might be more nuanced than that, but that’s basically all you need to know. You start off with each level being a tutorial in a different set of mechanics, but as soon as the game introduces enemies into the mix, you’ll have to fight for your life at every given moment.

Thankfully for you, you’re not just a normal person, you’re an unstoppable wall-running, floor-siding, bullet-timing badass whose only purpose in life is to kill people and look as cool as possible while doing so. Looking cool isn’t just for general bragging rights either, the cooler you look, the harder you are to hit, so it’s in your best interests to be running from wall to wall nonstop while taking out enemies in your path.

I’ll take that

What’s really interesting about Severed Steel, or at least the thing I’m going to write about in this moment, is that you don’t reload in the game, not really. Instead, your aim is to flow through the battlefield using the weapons you find on the floor, on the enemies, or wherever else they end up, to obliterate your foes. When they’re out of ammo, don’t fret, just throw them at someone and pick up something else to deal death with.

Of course, you can always choose to not shoot at people if you’d rather, and just dive kick them instead, sending them flying throw things, or sending things flying into them. You can find loads of different ways around each level too, because you can break through nearly everything you see.

In the early game, it takes a little bit of time to shoot your way through a reinforced door, but it is possible, but after a few levels you’ll find something that’ll add whole new layers to how you can play.

It’s the door-be-gone

Alongside the weapons you find on enemies, you do get one of your own. It’s basically a gigantic arm cannon, and it shows off the fact that most of the scenery is completely destroyable. This means that if the objective is on the other side of a couple of walls, you can just get rid of the walls.

It all ties in nicely to the free-flowing nature of the game. You’re not meant to be restricted by anything, you’re meant to be a wrecking ball in human form, and as you’re moving through the beautiful levels of Severed Steel you’ll become all the more adept at dealing death and removing problems.

It’s all genuinely a lot of fun. I do think there’s probably a little too much challenge for some people, and the short campaign won’t keep everyone’s attention, but for those who like to look cool and seek high scores, Severed Steel is going to be as hard to resist as an arm cannon through a flimsy window.",Severed Steel Review

8 Filled with small joys

My first camera was a Polaroid Joycam— a gift from a family member, and my first foray into photography. Yet this hulking item was too unwieldy for my child-sized hands, which made using it awkward. Nonetheless, it was incredibly precious to me; I was careful with my film, knowing that shots were finite as I take photos of treasured moments, like a picture of my aunt, or a really cool statue. If you asked me where any of those photos are right now, I couldn’t tell you, but that doesn’t really matter anyway. What mattered were the moments I captured at that time, and the small, fleeting joys that transpired.

TOEM is a game about reliving these very moments. It starts much in the same way; you get a vintage camera from your grandmother, and you make your way to find the titular TOEM, a mysterious event atop a mountain that your grandmother wants you to see for yourself. It’s far from the typical hero’s journey. In this game you’re just a kid who listens to cassette tapes, and now has an old camera to document that adventure with.

It reminded me of my summer trips to the Isle of Wight, making my own fun in ways only children can. Travelling by bus to get from place to place in TOEM was much the same as getting around the island (as if there is no other island in the world, as Jane Austen once wrote about the Isle of Wight), with the bus being the only form of public transport. Even through its monochromatic visuals, warmth and familiarity radiates from the game.

I grew up in London, and being somewhat of a nervous child, never felt entirely safe in the big smoke unless accompanied by an adult. Yet on the Isle of Wight, there was a sense of liberation I hadn’t experienced in my city upbringing. I could confidently take the overpriced bus anywhere I liked, and even if I didn’t end up anywhere notable, I was still excited about getting there. TOEM let me relive those moments from my childhood, with each location in the game being a playground to experiment in while unearthing secrets.

It’ll Last Longer

TOEM may seem like a photography game at first, but it isn’t really. Yes, the bulk of your time is spent looking down the barrel of a lens, but unlike other photography games such as Umurangi Generation or NEW Pokemon Snap, you don’t earn rewards or have your pictures rated.

Instead, it’s all about using your camera to interact with and discover the world around you. Sometimes that’ll be chancing upon some scouts playing hide and seek, or unearthing obscure things to take a picture of for the photo challenger guild, like a photo of yourself as a farmer even though you can’t dress as one. More often than not, you’ll be using your camera to help someone, like finding a lost pair of socks, or helping a ghost move on to the next life. These scenes, while seemingly insignificant, are marked by acts of kindness. And you do all of this with your newfound trusty camera.

TOEM the line

It’s unlikely any of these experiences will translate to stellar photography. You can only zoom through your camera lens (and after a while, honk your horn), while the focus can’t be altered. Having these features aren’t crucial though, since they would complicate the game’s message: that photography should be more instinctive rather than deliberate, more playful rather than premeditated. Maybe you saw a cool mushroom and just wanted to take a picture of it

Then there’s your character, whose age isn’t stated. They’re clearly young. The lack of these features was perhaps age-appropriate; when I was a child I certainly didn’t care what an aperture or a frame rate was.

This carefree approach to photography is incredibly liberating as you don’t have to fuss over minute details. If I saw a funny duck in a flying saucer, or skiing down a steep slope, I could take a quick picture and move on. There are no composition rules to follow, and no one else to hold yourself accountable to but, well, yourself. You’re just spending a day out, looking for the TOEM phenomenon.

I found my Polaroid Joycam some time in the last couple of years, and after a quick look online, I found that its film is out of production. With enough money and effort, I could find some older stock somewhere, but I don’t think I need to. The Polaroid has served its purpose in my youth, and I’m happy to just have the camera as a memento of the memories it captured.

Likewise, TOEM doesn’t have any particular resolution nor lesson to impart. You have no idea if your character would choose to pursue photography after their adventure, or if they even keep their camera. But these are inconsequential matters. What matters more is that you’ve captured those little moments, even if you won’t remember them forever. And I don’t think I need anything more from the game, too.",The Indie Game Website

8 Beautiful and wholesome

How do you say no to SkateBIRD? It’s skateboarding, which is rad, but with adorable little birds. Also, they wear hats and little scarves. When the opportunity to review SkateBIRD came across my desk, I was torn between Tales of Arise and Deathloop, but I dropped both games like a bad habit when SkateBIRD was sent to me. Was that a mistake? Heck no it wasn’t.

SkateBIRD has you begin by creating your bird, with plenty of options to choose from. Just the sheer variety of breeds is mindblowing; I have never heard of most of them, but boy, are there so many colourful birds. When you have created your skate bird, you are let loose on your first course, which is the messy bedroom of your Big Friend–an unnamed human who’s probably your owner.

On what is definitely an old fingerboard, you can skate around this giant room to your heart’s content. There are grind rails made out of drinking straws, half pipes made of cardboard and old magazines aptly named Thrusher. As you skate around, you will encounter other birds who will give you missions to complete. These come in a variety of classic objectives; high scores, combos, collecting letters, and more specific goals like cleaning the room through skateboarding. There’s plenty of variety, and even in completing every side mission I never got bored. These side missions can be completed quickly and easily, but what tugged at my heartstrings more is that they mostly resulted in fun interactions with other birds.

Plenty of birbs

Look, there’s no sense beating around the bush. Naturally, this game takes some cues from the original Birdman’s games: the Pro Skater series. Rather than filling each level with arbitrary goals and enforcing a time limit, you explore each level and interact with its cast of feathered friends. These conversations really are the heart of the game, as each bird is so full of character with personalities of their own. You will meet a scientist who will teach you how to make a bed using balloons and gravity. You will befriend a bird who wants to make the best skate park they can. You’ll even chance upon Sam King(fisher), a sneaky bird motivated only by snacks. All these interactions fed into the game’s central plot, which is another plus.

SkateBIRD has more heart than you might expect. You and your bird pals are beginning to worry for your Big Friend, who’s having a rough time and burning out from work. To give them a hand, the birds sought to help Big Friend, from tidying their room to fixing their problems at work. It’s one big adventure to help their favourite human take care of themselves and get well again. This wholesome tale of friendship–in which the birds embark on a joyous journey to aid their human, as they flit from rooftops to office desks and beyond–is fitting for a skateboarding game.

But what’s a skateboarding game without decent music, right? In this aspect, SkateBIRD does not disappoint. While you might not recognise all the tracks, most are sourced from contemporary bands, including genres like punk rock, ska, hip hop, which are the classic broad skater mix of anarchic rage and chill vibes. With the music they have nailed not just the sound, but also the spirit of skating–that community, activism and friendship are paramount–better than any skateboarding game has in decades. Their subjects range from sampling scientific descriptions of birds, to calling out racists and transphobes and decrying a system that has left young people incapable of affording a home.

The actual skateboarding itself is in the wheelhouse of the Birdhouse. If you have played a Tony Hawk game, the controls will be instantly familiar to you. Yet this isn’t Skate 4; tricks and perfect landings aren’t of vital importance. SkateBIRD is more concerned with having a good time with cool birds and chill skating. While there are challenging moments, rarely do they come with targets you need to hit, or strict time limits.

Leisurely skates

There were some mildly frustrating moments, but SkateBIRD wasn’t as frequently so as some of the early Tony Hawk games that it plays so much like, which I think is a pretty incredible achievement. Frustration has always felt like such an inescapable facet of skating games, and there are always going to be moments where you’re bumping into things, missing grind rails or just stuck in an awkward spot.

SkateBIRD minimises this with a handy feature: even when your bird de-boards, you still have control. As you roll about on the floor, you can manoeuvre your bird around with your “screm” (that is, flapping wildly and screaming, which I feel is something bird owners are used to) to reposition yourself before re-boarding and getting on with skating. I can’t tell you how many times this simple but fantastic solution has gotten me out of literal tight spaces: situations I have been in many times in other skateboarding games, but without nearly as elegant a solution as this.

Yet there is one thing I really couldn’t get into. There is a pretty extreme amount of blur on anything more than a few feet away from you. I’m not sure if this is supposed to mimic bird vision, or maybe a way to enforce the scale of things from your tiny perspective, but it’s an odd inclusion. Fortunately, the levels are laid out pretty well and simply. I rarely had a massive issue because of this distance blurring, or because I couldn’t see what was ahead of me. That said, it’s distracting and quite off-putting; far away objects were so blurred that I thought I needed new glasses. Searching for the next bird to talk to for the next mission can also be a bit tricky when said bird is just a colourful smudge in the distance.

Camaraderie galore

My expectations going in were relatively high. I’ve played a lot of games that are fun on paper, and in practice they are just that. But SkateBIRD turned out to be so much more. Skating around as a bird on a little fingerboard is as fun as it sounds, and the music is pitch-perfect with a message that is on point. The real magic of the game, however, comes from its feathered characters. Coming together like a patchwork blanket, their companionship feels like pieces of a comforting whole, as they help their friend through a tough time as a little avian community. SkateBIRD is a beautiful and heartwarming game, and it’s something that will stay with me for years to come.",The Indie Game Website

1.5 Uncritical and shallow

(Note: During the reviewers time with this game, parts of it broke over the course of review and as a result could not be fully completed).

Often, their voices have been muffled by the passage of time, the legacy of others or the very nature of the sources. But we must confront these challenges head on: give attention to forgotten lives for which we have little direct or reliable evidence; negotiate and discuss the complexities of nuanced relationships between performers and showmen and audiences; and unpack sources that often dabbled in fiction, falsity and fantasy. Frequently, the moment you think you have found the performer behind the performance, they disappear. But in this search for the performer, the culture of the period stands out and new insights appear.

– John Woolf, The Wonders: The Extraordinary Performers Who Transformed the Victorian Age

The circus was a critical signal of Western capital development in the late 1800s. With the combination of free time becoming more common among the working/middle class, and colonial capital pillaging the world for value, a mass spectacle of the exotic and unimaginable, which historically was produced for the upper class, was now becoming a form of mass entertainment. Animals that were only read about in books arrived in a parade at each town, along with performers with talents and traits exaggerated to create an othering fantasy of the performers. The tents went up, music blared throughout downtown, and a vacation-like land opened up next door.

Like all forms of entertainment under mass accumulated capitalism, the circus is a business practice that has largely been under-scrutinised for the sake of romanticizing notions of “escapism”. So many books, documentaries, and interviews have been archived to capture the “magical” nature of the circus. Meanwhile, the exhibitionists’ and workers and the animals stolen through European colonisation were rarely documented. The little documents we do have hold cruel images and memories. Take for example, the way that P.T. Barnum got his start by brutally working an elderly Black woman he owned, Joice Heth, to death and then putting her post mortem dissection on as a show. Rarely do these stories about the circus provide details of the ways animals and people alike were abused for profit.

A Circus of Images

The newly released Amazing American Circus co-developed by Klabater and Juggler Games, is set during the heyday of this circus-trending time period, and puts the player in the position as a circus manager taking over the family business. Traveling across the recently colonised cities of Western America, the player is tasked with managing the troupe’s skills, hiring on new acts, and most of all, directing a successful show.

The Amazing American Circus touts itself as an exploration of gilded age America, setting the game’s theme as a video game historical exploration in line with other titles Klabater has published in the past (We. The Revolution, Help Will Come Tomorrow, The is the Zodiac Speaking). While the game doesn’t necessarily go out of its way with a deep narrative to explore this history, it does so through what is included in the game’s Western cultural representations of history and what is excluded.

A large part of the game’s imagery and mechanics surround the actual circus performers themselves. At the start of the game the player begins with a juggler, clown, and strongman then over the course of the game more entertainers join. Some that joined me during the course of my game were the counting chicken, a mime, a trapeze artist, a Chinese mask changer, and bigfoot. While some of these entertainers are either athletic/trapeze artists or what Barnum called “humbug” acts, other entertainers are incredibly out of date forms of entertainment from the time period with harmful implications in their name and/or act. One example I found specifically appalling was receiving a misfit named “savage” as a reward for playing a number of shows.

What’s frustrating about this representation of the circus’ foundations in exoticism and othering is that it doesn’t attempt to provide information as to why these forms of entertainment were popular at the time, and how they were harmful for marginalised entertainers. Most of these characters don’t have dialogue or stories aside from quest flavor text. The only information to take away from their representations are the names that the characters are given, and the ways their mechanics in the card game function. This is why presenting characters in ways such as the “savage” reward is harmful, because there is nothing being done to learn about the flaws of dominant history and its damages. It becomes another circus, perpetuating the harm through an uncritical historical reproduction.

Power in Performance

The gameplay itself is fairly obtuse, to the point that sometimes it’s hard to even read into what is happening. Following a fairly traditional turn-based battle system, the player manages three performers through circus acts as they “battle” the audience to a victorious show. It’s a bit of a strange mapping of performance onto a battle system, in the similar way that the WWE video games feel strange as a fighting game. Performance is such a complex, unique act between the audience and performer. Perhaps the most fitting place for this battle-style performance gameplay would fit at a stand up open mic comedy hour where someone is bombing. Yet, in the context of a circus show it feels that so many forms of emotion are lost. Whether someone is afraid of clowns, lustfully desiring the bodies on display, amazed by animals unseen before, or discomforted by the exploitation of the show is all boiled down to a health bar and some status effects.

After playing the game for this review, there are still parts of the game design I didn’t understand such as “sneering” or “transfigure”. A lot of this review is focused on the representation of the game’s historical themes. Part of the reasoning for that is because it provokes criticism, but another part is that the gameplay doesn’t provide much depth nor understanding to go deeper. At some point I started playing many of my performances with the same characters and the same strategies because it always resulted in a victory.

Who writes history?

Broadly, the game’s depths of history aren’t much different from the big top. A harmonica bristles over a guitar’s rhythm as the player gazes across the cities they will take their next show to. They are responsible for choosing what their troupe eats, and spending money to discover more of the states, yet the map is an empty plane only marking American governed cities. There is very little ecology or geology to see across the country, nor any notion that these states are anything other than American owned territory, which is surprising considering this time period was at the height of the US military’s violent plundering of land still inhabited by Native Americans.

Whether it’s on our phones or in video games, maps are always political. They are constructed symbols conveying ideological information about land and people. The expression of Amazing American Circus’ map communicates that this era of America was fairly empty outside of the American occupied cities and some outliers. Sometimes a random encounter may occur along a trail where a random traveler appears, but not much else happens.

It should be noted that despite my critiques, I want to note that The Amazing American Circus isn’t doing anything uniquely egregious in its engagement of history. It is a game that presents pop cultural history: one that isn’t attempting to reveal anything new, but reproduce a dominant understanding of a time period for atmosphere and entertainment. History is as much the past as it is the understanding of our present. A historical video game prioritises and engages with contemporary agency and understanding of the past over the historical document. The Amazing American Circus is not even a historical document, but a media text taking the form of a video game.",The Amazing American Circus Review

6 Silent indifference

[INFORMATION DROP DETECTED]

[DROP #1] It is a tricky thing to attempt to build a game that asks the player to do unpleasant things. It is so easy, in the environment of something so inherently elective as a video game, to simply decline. One could, without almost any effort at all, do quite literally just about anything else. So if Strange Scaffold’s new non-shooting space war courier game, Can Androids Survive, wishes to suggest that maybe the player isn’t really serving a greater purpose in gathering and delivering weapons and information at the cost of their own life, again and again, then the question at play might not be whether they can find a means within the game to stop doing so; it’s why one shouldn’t take the game at its own word and simply hit the escape key.

[DROP #2] Unpleasant games—which is to say games that seek to model unpleasant systems—have to do something specifically in place of offering a pleasurable experience. Frequently, that something is intended to be some sort of a message. Illuminating, perhaps, the way that an unpleasant system works in real life, like the arbitrary and oppressive nature of customs and immigration systems in the game Papers, Please.

[DROP #3] In Can Androids Survive, this message is supposed to be the indifference in systems of war to the dignity and humanity to the individuals necessary to enact and sustain the systems of war.

[DROP 4] I kind of feel like we’re generally aware of the annihilation of the individual inherent in the condition of war. [Dulce et Decorum Est, The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner, Catch-22, and that’s just three white guys writing about the first half of the 20th century.]

[DROP #5] Although, in fairness, that understanding doesn’t seem to have had much impact on our willingness to enter and sustain a condition of war.

[DROP #6] In fact, the immediate resurrection of the player (or, at least, the absolute interchangeability of a succession of mechs, linked by the player’s tendency to imbue each mech with their own sense of identity as a single character rather than a series of distinct individuals—one Mario with many lives rather than many plumbers with the same moustache, each dying a single death) enacted by Can Androids Survive’s potentially endless sequence of destruction and redeployment, works against a message about the annihilation of the individual in a state of war. The individual is already dead. The individual survives.

[DROP #7] It’s also contrary to Strange Scaffold’s previous game, Can Androids Pray, which through a mostly linear conversation between two disabled mechs, presents an intensely particular and compelling vision of the survival of the individual in the face of absurdity, an indifferent universe, and impending death.

[DROP #8] I played Can Androids Pray for the first time while reviewing Can Androids Survive, and I loved it so much that I want to overlook the shortcomings, the empty centre of the latter in the hope of supporting the people capable of making something as unique and beautiful as the former.

[DROP #9] But they are two wildly different things. Can Androids Pray is a narrative. Can Androids Survive is a behaviour simulator.

[DROP #10] Behaviour simulators are attempts to model, understand, and/or critique systems of power by enacting a system of power through designed constraints on participant activity, while maintaining some semblance of participant agency. This is. . . difficult. Systems of power often do not require any assistance in reconstituting themselves.

[DROP #11] Games require an end state. Narratives simply require an ending. Simulations, in and of themselves, require neither.

[DROP #12] All of which is to say that Can Androids Survive is a game that is working to be a simulator (an unruly hybrid in the best of cases) that positions itself as a sequel to a story. If it doesn’t really quite pull any of these things off successfully, there is at least some consolation in the fact that in the end, as promised, the player gets to blow up the moon. I’m not sure that it works as a message, but it’s nice to get some consideration for not having hit the escape key an hour or so earlier.

9 Deeply human

As I sit down to write this review, it’s cold and miserable outside. It’s weather that my grandad would call “perfect for a murder”–and in the case of Twelve Minutes, where the game takes place on a cold and stormy night, that feels appropriate.

The concept of Twelve Minutes is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. The atmosphere for the entire game is set within the first few moments when the character you control must ignore the feeling of impending dread, as you casually stroll across the carpet from The Shining to get to your apartment door. Upon entering your apartment, you’re greeted enthusiastically by your wife. She says there is a special surprise lined up for you tonight, before long an aggressive knock comes from your front door. Before anyone can respond, a policeman starts shouting for you to open the door.

When the door opens, things move fast. Your quiet night in with your wife turns into a horror movie. Before you can find out what the police officer wants, both of you are tied up and thrown on the floor. And no matter what you do next, the result is always the same. The police officer kills you, and just like that, you’re back at your apartment door with your wife greeting you once more, telling you she has a surprise. This means you have ten minutes to try and figure out what is happening, stop it from happening and break out of this loop, before time runs out and you’re standing at the door once more.

Deja vu

It’s almost like a sense of deja vu. You’ll enter a room and get this overwhelming feeling that this exact thing has happened before. For most of us, this feeling is mostly inconsequential. But for your character in Twelve Minutes, it is instead the absolute, agonising truth–that you have lived this moment before countless times.

Essentially, Twelve Minutes is a classic point-and-click game with a time loop thrown in. Knowing you only have ten minutes to figure everything out creates a level of tension that ratchets up until the game is over. You can pick items up, combine them with other objects in your inventory, and use them to unlock conversations and unravel the mystery. Progressing through Twelve Minutes is about leveraging this information to move forward in subsequent loops.

You play the entire game with a top-down view of the world and characters, never getting to see their faces. While this prevents you from drawing conclusions about the characters based on their appearances, it also means that their emotions are expressed through their voices only. A poor voice acting cast could have caused the game to fall flat, but thanks to the impressive cast which is made up of Daisy Ridley, Willem Dafoe and James McAvoy, it doesn’t.

Incredibly human

But the real magic of Twelve Minutes isn’t in the story or even the concept; it’s in the characters’ very human and relatable reactions to the situations they unwittingly find themselves in. I found myself laughing more than once because a spat would break out between my character and their wife. The cause may be trivial, but it’s a fight that I’ve had with my own partner before, pretty much word for word. And as you play through loop after loop, your character’s despair, anxiety, and anguish at being stuck start to mirror your own in a way that feels like you are both genuinely trapped in this together.

While Twelve Minutes is a single-player game, it quickly became a team effort as my partner gradually got drawn in. This feels like the best way to experience the game. Having someone else to bounce ideas and theories off of created such an engaging and interactive experience and when the story concluded, it had both my partner and me proclaiming that we were right about the game’s ending.

Twelve Minutes was one of the most interactive and enjoyable games I’ve played in a long while. Even though playing through the same loop again, and again, and again won’t be for everyone, I found the process of changing up my actions each time and moving forward, little by little, to be oddly satisfying, and the sense of accomplishment whenever I made a considerable leap forward was unmatched.

Like an adult Cluedo, where you need to figure out the who, what, where and why of a murder mystery, Twelve Minutes is a must-play. It’s honestly one of the most engaging games I’ve played all year.",Twelve Minutes Review

9 Poignant and moving

Hopeless. This is a word that can describe how I felt during most of my time with Recompile, a game by studio Phigames. Of course, this wasn’t the only emotion I had while traveling around its dark and intriguing biomes, all inside a “system” of unknown origin. There was genuine joy, discovery, even some laughs with some of the initial log files you need to pick up to know about the story. However, I haven’t felt so insignificant while playing a video game in years.

In Recompile, you play as a “program”/”virus”, represented in a human form, with a clear mission: infect a system, stop an AI called Hypervisor, and reveal the story behind a group of people working on a secret project. The reasons behind these objectives? Hidden. How harsh will the journey be? Extremely. Any chance to go back and disobey your creators’ will? Not found.

To complete these objectives, told by an enigmatic guide known as Janus, you have to reach certain locations, turn on power cores, jump across multiple platforms and delete enemy drones that serve as antiviruses. You can use different types of “guns” with unlimited ammo and sometimes imprecise but comfortable gunplay to destroy those threats, but the first moments are tragic. Your first weapon–a basic pistol–is pretty weak compared to the robots and the amount of damage they can easily deal. I found myself struggling in my first hour, dying from green lasers and virtual yellow bullets more times than I’m willing to admit.

Program your jump

Eventually, more powerful weapons are unlocked, which makes encounters against common enemies a walk in the park. However, Recompile is more platformer than action. Jumping from a black block to another one is a delight, partly due to its visual identity: the platforms are basically black geometric pieces scattered in big areas with only a distinctive color or two. This is backgrounded by a gorgeous aesthetic that only has a few elements. Every area is full of interesting details, striking visuals, and unquestionable originality; the TET Biome uses red as an indicator of danger, and is normally crowded with more enemies than any other biome. On the other hand, the OKT Biome, more focused on platforming and near impossible jumps, taps on yellow with touches of purple and dark blue to create a more relaxing environment. Although there are specific areas in which discerning where you would land is challenging due to a lack of color or an overly bright light generator, traveling around these places is a pleasure.



None of this wouldn’t matter if the jumping or traversal abilities felt unresponsive or lacked substance. Fortunately, it’s the other way around. Other abilities you’ll soon unlock keep this invigorating, like multiple jumps and dashes.

On the other hand, Recompile’s platforming is also nerve-racking: in some biomes, you are a tiny silhouette in a massive galaxy-like scenario. It’s hard not to feel oppressed by the enormity of the space around you, even if you’re in open areas most times. Every fall is a descent into darkness, only briefly interrupted by your own red light.

What’s more is that this title also has an unorthodox level design. You may know where to go or what to do thanks to Janus’ suggestions at the beginning, but reaching your destination is another story. Visual clues such as wires and other elements are sprawled on the map, but Recompile has a sense of verticality and freedom that might make you question where to go at first. However, its complicated design becomes rewarding once you start to understand its idiosyncrasies. After getting lost in its initial moments, a melody soon started to guide my steps, one that’s leading me to upgrades or to progress the story

Know your virus

Apart from its entertaining and challenging platforming, Recompile’s story has infected my own mind days after completing the game. This tale is gradually unveiled through logs placed across the levels. These files contain dialogues, packed with programming languages and sweet references, between workers and Hypervisor. What started as simple chit-chat with funny jokes and light-hearted comments between friends and acquaintances gradually becomes anguishing and maddening.

As we discover the motives of these workers, the AI will improve and become increasingly human. Hypervisor, after some updates, will start asking the workers about how they are feeling, and attempt to aid them if needed in a display of genuine empathy. In another stressful situation, in which the workers are desperate about what’s going on, the AI tries to take their pain away by speaking to them and finding a solution to their emergencies.

A certain log, including a reading of a metaphor, sent shivers down my spine. It showed a dialogue between Hypervisor and the worker responsible for the AI’s improvements, who was trying to teach poetry and interpretation to the virtual entity. Hypervisor not only succeeded in the task: it created a new poem that showed a sinister desire, one that isn’t normally associated with machines.

Recompile has plenty to say about both science fiction classic topics, like what differentiates ourselves from machines, and our daily lives via an existentialist and a pessimistic, frightening perspective. The horrifying answer seems to be that only harsh situations and the possibility of violence can shape our identity. This was the eventual plight of the workers, who I was soon filled with deep sorrow for, and I never saw even a picture of them–just a few dialogues here and there.

Perhaps what’s most interesting is how Recompile made me care about a virus, a real-life nuisance. But here it’s so small and insignificant, as it faced danger in every square and moving inside a hostile virtual world.

Final thoughts

Recompile isn’t without issues. The bosses are weirdly impossible to overcome without an ability—slow motion—which you can easily miss while advancing in your journey. Technical issues also mar the experience slightly, such as the program being instantly destroyed when falling from high altitudes, but the distances are not that visible. And when you perform an inaccurate jump and fall to the void, you won’t be terminated until you reach the bottom, which means you can be free-falling for about ten seconds before the round concludes.

However, these problems are secondary to the mixed, complicated emotions I experienced–from the pure joy and satisfaction when finishing a challenging area, to more complex and bitter thoughts about our humanity–and our efforts to be better. Hypervisor provokes conversations not only about our daily dependence on technology, our increasing levels of anxiety around it, or the isolation bubbles created through social media, but how our imminent future could be made even worse. Hopefully, we can change this trajectory before it’s too late–if it isn’t already too late.",The Indie Game Website

6 Repetitive but almost charming

Picogram’s top-down adventure Garden Story has a bit of an identity crisis, and how you feel about that will likely decide how much you enjoy the game. It has more in common with old-school Zelda games than with the farm or life sims that its cute pastel art suggests, such as their clu​​nky features and a pretty tedious activity loop.

You play as Concord, a grape in a land of sweetly named fellow produce who’re called Fuji, as well as frog denizens. The game is divided overall into four seasonal areas, beginning with the Spring Hamlet where Concord was born. Concord is promoted to the big leagues as a Guardian of the land, tasked with objectives to fulfill so as to protect their peers from an invasive species called the Rot. Each village is surrounded by areas filled with enemies as well as resources like plants, boulders, and tree stumps.

Each day, Concord is given two to three goals, like delivering a handful of a specific resource or ridding an area of its enemies. But by my third day in-game, my slate of goals was just slight variations to the ones I had on the first day. Garden Story definitely struggles to make the repetitive gathering and combat tasks more interesting.



Confusing and frustrating

Combat is one of the places where the game is the least fleshed out, as is the crossover between combat and the game’s other, more pastoral, goals. Your HP begins with a Zelda-like three “hearts” to start, with upgrades that increase your maximum health throughout the game. Fighting uses progressively stronger weapons and household implements too. Plus, each chapter concludes with a boss fight, featuring bosses that take around 20 hits to kill.

If Concord dies during combat, the day immediately ends with a small financial penalty. That feels frustrating when the only way to level up your stats and unlock content is by completing the daily gathering and combat goals—but failure to complete them usually means just being shut out of them rather than being imposed a reset penalty. I found myself wondering about hard resetting quickly after dying, because the game only saves during your overnight rests.

This game wants to be very charming, and it sometimes comes very close. The art is rich and beautiful, and the interfaces look great. But every other aspect of the game feels one step away from being memorable. Menus are confusing and difficult to use. Locations are overly greebled with landmarks and winding paths, making it difficult to get around with ease or speed—and the map is obtuse, instead of helpful, at a glance.



A poor mish-mash of genres

But at the end of the day, I’m just not sure who Garden Story is really for. Combat has no innate reward outside of reward tasks, so people who love to fight will tire of the same small set of enemies. The punishing boss fights feel cruel instead of satisfying. Gathering resources can be fun but repetitive. There’s a library to fill with each area’s seasonal items, but I wasn’t inclined to look for them because of the sheer amount of repetition. I accumulated a bunch of money, but most shops had only cosmetic items to sell.

The bottom line is that I felt worn out playing Garden Story, as its 20ish-hour runtime stretched out and felt much longer than it should be. Comparisons to Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing don’t feel right, nor does Zelda apart from the game’s tough, repetitive combat. Maybe the takeaway is that being the town hero really does involve doing a lot of the same work over and over–a less glamorous but no less applicable life lesson.",Garden Story Review

9 Warm and emotional

Death is such an inevitable part of life that there is certainly no shortage of it in games, usually in bloody and violent fashion. So when a game comes along that tackles the complex emotional sea surrounding it in a sensitive and unique way, it immediately stands out. Spiritfarer by Thunder Lotus Games dived in headfirst and became one with the waves in a wonderful way.



Charon, the legendary ferryman of the Dead, has decided to retire and pass on his underworldly duties. As Stella, along with fluffy sidekick Daffodil, you are the new blood entrusted with said duties. Using the ‘Everlight’—a magical orb that can transform into any desired object—and your sturdy boat, you must welcome spirits aboard and help them discover what they need to move on before finally ferrying them through the Everdoor to the world beyond.

During its marketing campaign, Spiritfarer was dubbed as “a cozy management sim about dying”; a statement that carries both a warm light-hearted air and an undertone of incredible weight. It’s also one that’s spot-on! The game revolves around building up and customising your ship to accommodate your spiritual guests, as well as learning more about them through conversation, quests and even food. To accomplish this, you need to sail to different island locations in the spirit world and acquire various items for crafting and cooking.

So you take to your navigation map, plot your course and get sailing! Like any management sim, maintaining balance can be sometimes tricky, but never does it become overwhelming or off-putting. The atmosphere is still effortlessly cosy and it’s unbelievably easy to spend an unearthly amount of hours on it. And if you ever do start to feel a little management pressure, you can give your feline follower a cuddle and feel rejuvenated.

Not so grim

Given the subject matter, it’s easy to think that the journey will be filled with heart-wrenching tear-jerkers at every turn. At times the emotional impact can take a toll on you, but Spiritfarer doesn’t just immediately go for the gut punch. There is an almost tangible sense of purpose and fulfilment; as you talk to spirits and complete quests for them, you feel the multifaceted warmth of developing a close companionship. You get genuine joy out of cooking their favourite foods and giving them a big hug to pep them up when they’re feeling a little low. Spirits have a variety of different memories and emotions and, despite their animalistic appearance, their responses are unabashedly human. This is all the more poignant with the game originally released during the throes of a pandemic, when people were isolated from those they felt closest to and robbed of connection and companionship–and developer Thunder Lotus delivered warmth in exquisite fashion.

Complementing this is a first class soundtrack. Calming, sweeping, adventurous, heart-warming, this score by Max LL has it all. From evocative piano and acoustic guitar to delicate flutes, bombastic trumpets and Southeast Asian sounds, the tracks punctuate every aspect of Stella’s journey as the Spiritfarer perfectly. Ancient mythological elements are illustrated with a modern twist, reminiscent of Studio Ghibli movie scores in its heartfelt nature. You are being invited to become an important and integral part of a deeply personal story.

Illustrative magic

And of course, I saved the best for last. Games with striking visuals will never fail to work their illustrative magic on me. Every time I think I’ve seen the heights of graphical greatness, the bar is raised ever higher; Spiritfarer is off the scale. Vibrant hand-drawn character animations mix beautifully with backgrounds channelling the essence of ancient Japanese tapestry. The animations are so intricate and expressive with every scene. Stella’s reactions to different facets of conversations are wonderfully charming. While a spirit is describing house improvements they’d like, she turns the Everlight into blueprints and begins sketching. If they make a happy discovery, she claps her hands in joy. And anyone who fails to fall in love with Daffodil and her adorable antics probably has a heart of stone. Watching her meow in perfect harmony while Stella plays guitar or hanging off the other end of a cross-cut saw when chopping down a tree is enough to make your head explode into candy!

There’re always slight concerns about how non-exclusive games will ‘fare’ aboard a Switch, but it’s all smooth sailing with this one. Spiritfarer is a fantastic title that runs like a dream and firmly delivers on its warm aura interlaced with emotional weight. Beautifully executed in its approach to complex subjects, players will be thoroughly engrossed and immersed in the nautical spirit world Stella and Daffodil inhabit, and the carefully built (if inevitably fleeting) friendships of unique spiritual companions. Step through the Everdoor and see what’s on the other side.",The Indie Game Website

7.5 Sardonic and provoking

“After the great ecological catastrophe, the ultra rich moved to Tesla City on Mars. Now, citizens of Mars take charter flights to Earth and play golf in the ruins of civilization.” With this introduction, along with a statement that the game “has no intention to defame”―a pointed departure from the boilerplate “any resemblance to any person living or dead…”―Golf Club Wasteland sets its satirical stakes from the very start.

You play as a lone astronaut, putting his way through derelict scenes. Yachts trashed by partygoers give way to abandoned construction sites, broken up living accommodation, and areas aggressively reclaimed by nature. You learn at one point that whoever set up the golf course also turned the neon lights that cover the buildings in brand names and logos back on. Why not, at this point, waste power, when there’s nobody left to use it?

While the wasteland is far from your traditional golf course, with a pool of toxic waste being as likely a hazard as a natural lake, it’s hard not to see a critique of golf itself in the game. As science communicator Abbie Richards put it, “Golf celebrates the wastage of resources and degradation of nature for the benefit of the select few who can afford it.” This particular golf club came after ecological catastrophe, but would that catastrophe have come without the people who play golf?



Class act

The class of people who play golf are the most interesting thing Golf Club Wasteland uses to make its starkly sardonic point. While you play, you listen to Radio Nostalgia on Mars. The station’s programming is made up of songs, PSAs, and callers-in reminiscing about the good times on Earth. In one instance, after the oft-requested “anthem to the evacuation” ‘Two Astronauts’ plays, the host pleasantly reminds listeners that it is necessary that everyone recycle their urine.

It’s a striking one-two of propaganda and PSA, that’s all the more effective for the song being genuinely enjoyable―I saved it off the OST, recycling reminder and all. But what’s more overtly sinister are the subjects the callers choose to reminisce about. An oil executive declares himself one for the history books, for having the contacts to predict that the catastrophe was going to happen―and to start mining on Mars, instead. Another person complains about the nature noises in the meditation room, because it’s nature’s fault they had to evacuate, and suggests the sounds of her old commute. A geologist bitterly discredits Earth conservation efforts, because more like him should have been planning ahead for the inevitability of life on Mars.

The conditions of life on Mars might be objectively unpleasant, but each caller is self-obsessed to the point of solipsism. It could seem over-the-top, but it doesn’t. You’ve met these people in real life―or at least seen them posting on Twitter. The only person who ever points out that other people died, that other people were dying before the evacuation is a labourer who evacuated by accidental case of mistaken identity. In other words, explicitly not somebody who plays golf. The blissed-out host―who has been reminding others to take their implied-to-be-sedative O-Mass―glosses over the loss, and can only comment on how lucky the labourer was.

The world of golf

With the radio playing almost constantly, cutting out only when the astronaut loses signal, the feeling I had when playing Golf Club Wasteland was that of a podcast game (which, as an aside, I wish was subtitled slightly more accurately as a result. Non-English speech is sometimes translated without comment, and profane language substituted). It isn’t to say that the golf wasn’t good. On the contrary, each level is a mini playground, with opportunities for clever, satisfying and slightly silly trick-shots. Even so, it was primarily an experience of sight and sound―golfing was something to do with my hands, and a way to traverse through the levels.

The astronaut’s story, then, caught me by surprise. Even with the sense of personality that came through in his animations―and the disgust he expressed at one point with Radio Nostalgia―it was at a distance. As his backstory unrolled, backloaded heavily into the ending sequence, I wasn’t emotionally compelled. His disillusionment and hope both felt flattened by the satirical tone of the rest of the game.

In the end, however, Golf Club Wasteland didn’t need to sell me on its main character for it to work. It tells more than a story about one person or one moment. Instead, its strength is in the world it creates, the microstories of each level, and the layers of social critique in each part of its radio broadcasts. The rich will watch the world burn and complain about the glare―best make sure that golf course is shady.",Golf Club Wasteland Review

Here’s our monthly bite-sized reviews on some good ol’ indies to round up the month of August. Take a look at these:



Escape from Naraka

Acrobatic fun

One of the most striking features in the first-person platformer, Escape from Naraka, is that your enemies can’t be killed–at least not through conventional methods, such as by shooting a barrage of ice missiles against them and hoping they’ll congeal and break. This makes sense; after all, these are Balinese gods, demons and mythical creatures you’re up against as you traverse through a temple–like one who resembles the elephant-headed god Ganesha, who will be standing guard at specific entrances. Instead, getting past them requires some quick wits and acrobatic prowess, as you’ll need to time your attacks to stun them–all while traipsing across floating platforms and crumbling structures. Escape from Naraka takes the best–and unfortunately, some flaws–of classic platformers; making precise leaps can be challenging when you can’t see your feet. At the same time, it also injects some of the studio’s own culture and twists into the environments, letting you immerse in a Southeast Asian-inspired universe that’s as mystical as it’s alluring.

Green Phoenix

Not much humanity or spirit left

Green Phoenix is an on-rails arcade shooter that seeks to examine grandiose concepts like freedom and the price of humanity. The truth is, however, that the game is just an extensive monologue by the spaceship’s robotic-sounding AI, as it recalls its pilot’s history of debt and slavery, as they’re held captive by unscrupulous megacorporations. Even so, this context feels alarmingly separate from the rest of the game, as you’re simply steering a spaceship through floating debris and sniping at asteroids and flying turrets. The worlds you’re coasting through aren’t particularly imaginative too, and look like they’re simply plucked from the discarded remnants of sci-fi worlds. What’s left, then, is Green Phoenix’s immediate and otherwise most compelling feature: its arcade shooter elements. Even so, that’s still devoid of much pizzazz or spunk. In an attempt to elevate itself beyond just an action-based shooter, Green Phoenix has unfortunately become more humdrum than invigorating.

Metal Dogs (Early Access)

Get metal geared up

Metal Dogs has an adorable premise: you play as a shiba inu named Pochi, and is strapped with an assortment of military-grade weaponry to cause wanton destruction amidst a post-apocalyptic universe. Putting aside the perfunctory backstory about humanity going AWOL, you begin by heading to different maps and blasting the bejeezus out of every ridiculous moving thing there: giant ants, heavily armored tanks, robot hippopotamuses outfitted with canons, and more.

The game is a mix of top-down shooting and bullet-hell as you sought to avoid pellets of destruction and massive rocket launchers aimed towards you; after all, not getting your cute pooch killed as he prances around the battlefield should be a huge incentive in itself. There are also a variety of weapons to collect, even though the arsenal can be limited, as well as opportunities to tinker and upgrade your guns at a weapons workshop. While Metal Dogs isn’t all that revolutionary, it’s endlessly charming and delightful thanks to its indefatigable canine protagonist–and yes, that includes the two other doggo friends you can recruit during your journey–as well as its frankly exhilarating battles.

Rustler

Grand Theft Horse

Rustler isn’t shy about its homage to the classic Grand Theft Auto games, as it puts on its persona as a goofy, medieval Grand Theft Auto imitator with unabashed glee. You play as a nondescript dude named Guy, a ne’er do well who spends his days picking fights, stealing horses for gold, launching cows onto rooftops, and a plethora of get-rich schemes. In short, it’s a sandbox of open-ended missions you can choose to partake in. If you’re bored, however, you can also go rogue and do whatever the hell you want, like go on a murderous spree for the local gravekeeper, who is into collecting dead bodies. There’s even an in-game radio, too; you can also hire a bard to follow you around and sing some medieval tunes.

Want to switch channels though? Just punch the bard in the face to get him to play a different melody. And that’s the gist of Rustler’s low-brow humour; there’s even a dedicated fart and burp key you can press, and its jokes can be good for a few chuckles. For instance, the sight of knights chasing after you on horseback, while wearing flashing red and blue emergency lights, never ceases to amuse me. That said, its jokes do wear thin after a while. It’s also a fitting analogy for Rustler: good for a few hours of light-hearted fun, but ultimately not that memorable.

Toodee and Topdee

Topsy turvy perspectives

Puzzle games usually have to tread a precarious tightrope between delivering brain teasers of a sizable challenge, versus frustrating players with overly difficult puzzles that would leave them feeling too inadequate to continue. Toodee and Topdee manages to traverse that rope with ease, as well as with ample smarts to boot–all by melding together two disparate perspectives, from two protagonists who see their universe in contrasting ways.

The trick, therefore, is to bend these puzzles to their advantage. You play as both Toodee and Topdee; Toodee perceives their world in 2D, whereas Topdee does so in 3D. Solving these puzzles means having to alternate between them, with Topdee occasionally nudging platforms and boxes towards Toodee from within their own plane. Along with having to perform some well-timed maneuvers, this also makes for several terribly clever puzzles, which also makes me feel very clever at times.

6 Beautiful but depthless

One of the most anticipated indies from the 2021 Wholesome Direct stream, Hoa is a pastoral vision of tranquil forest scenery and sweet anthropomorphic animals. Some players might invoke the Studio G-word (hint: it rhymes with “jibbly”) to describe Hoa’s aesthetic, an overused shorthand for a very specific combination of meticulous animation and hand-painted backgrounds. My dearest Christmas wish is for people to move away from this catch-all descriptor because frankly we are calling literally anything and everything Ghibli these days.

That being said, Hoa is absolutely beautiful—it’s clear that Skrollcat Studio poured a lot of time and care into crafting the game’s serene vibe. It’s a fairly easy puzzle-platformer—there are hints of Hollow Knight inspirations here and there, such as the map design, but none of the punishing mechanics. The worst thing that can happen to your character, a tiny fairy, is getting rudely kicked across the screen by a robot NPC. There’s no combat, which is nice for a change, and really lets you indulge in the bucolic forest setting.

But Hoa, with all of its sumptuous visuals, lacks the narrative depth that makes these kinds of intimate worlds so charming. There are several different levels filled with nervous, kind ladybugs, gentle rock creatures, and gruff stag beetles, each with marginally different abilities to help your tiny fairy on their way. The idea is to light up engravings that awaken different “bosses,” all of whom saw you pass through their realms as a baby on the run from evil machines. Each boss alludes to some kind of past conflict where your parents tried to hide you, and you were saved by a mysterious someone. This someone is literally referred to several times in the game as “that guy”, a tonally questionable translation choice that snaps me out of Hoa’s pleasant reverie. The dialogue in each themed area is largely interchangeable—everyone gives you the same canned warning.

Missed opportunities

At the first prompt of actual violence in the game, there’s a drawn-out cutscene that seems like a wasted opportunity to give players a chance for a challenge. After freeing the robot who saved your life all those years ago, the robot urges you to flee before its evil programming takes over. And so, your tiny fairy form has to speed through a snarl of platforms in a menacing factory, in what looks like a pretty thrilling gauntlet-style platforming sequence—if only it was playable. Even if it clashes with the game’s combat-free vibe, the option would have been a rewarding taste of what makes platformers so exhilarating for certain players.

After your “death,” you enter the reverse-control portion of the game—a starkly beautiful black-and-white realm that is ostensibly a sort of afterlife-limbo, and my own personal hell. It starts off as a fairly straightforward asymmetric split-screen level—obstacles and objects in the top half of the screen are different from the bottom half, and you must call on all the powers you’ve learned to get through them. Then comes a truly demonic section that brings Hoa’s whole concept as a pleasant, “easy” experience into question—an inverse movement section where you must do the same platforming mechanics while the camera tilts at inhumane angles. I’m not sure how 49% of players on Steam seem to have this section done, but I simply cannot get past one very specific part that, for almost an hour, was becoming the bane of my entire existence.

All style, little substance

Hoa is ultimately more about style rather than substance, and while this makes for a lovely visual experience, it’s rather shallow. Unlike its fellow puzzle-platformer brethren, the game doesn’t have much lore or even basic worldbuilding details for an engaging playthrough—there are no items to collect besides glowing butterflies, and nothing in the world that tells a larger story about the plight of your people. Perhaps the biggest blow is that after a certain point, I gave up on learning more about my little fairy and the worlds we moved through. It all falls rather flat, which is a shame given all the gorgeous background painting and adorable character work that went into development.

Perhaps Hoa is meant to be a vehicle for the art, and if so, there should be an option to nerf the reverse-control section so that we can appreciate said art without wanting to claw our eyes out. It’s also pretty funny how often you get Steam achievements—within the first few minutes of starting the game, you get three achievements including one for literally starting the game and another for moving to the next area (Steam achievements, of course, mean nothing). It’s a nice way to pass the time if you want a relatively stress-free platformer that’s easy on the eyes, but even as Hoa demands little from you as a player, it also offers little as an escape.",The Indie Game Website

8.5 Disgustingly delicious

What does the husk of a decaying universe look like? For Death Trash, that is the scenes of destruction and towering metal structures, which are marked by splotches of mysterious, quivering pink meat just sprouting everywhere: growing at corners of an abandoned building, or bursting through the crevices of a blackened cave. Fleshy worms wriggle around too, where these enigmatic sinews thicken and convulse. It’s an immensely abhorrent but fascinating sight—one that pricks at your imagination about the calamity that brought about this world’s reckoning. I’m pretty sure there’s some sort of B-movie monstrosity lurking underneath the decrepit surface.

What’s more is that all these flesh is good enough to eat too, which makes for a convenient, if not crass, diet for the dwellers here. And they never seem to run out; even the grubby worms nearby can be harvested for food. Some folks even hunger for the meat aggressively, as they gorge themselves silly on these pink blobs in communities that congregate around their growth, or bars that are set up near these abominable sources of food. At the same time, there are also a small handful of survivors who eye the strange meat with suspicion, instead embracing a vegan diet, as they gnaw on alien cactuses for nutrition.

I’ve not considered being a vegetarian in games before, and this freedom to pick dietary preferences is an anomalous one for post-apocalyptic worlds. Unlike most games in the genre where scarcity is the norm, and survival is contingent on hoarding resources—starving dwellers are often begging for and fighting over morsels to survive in those games—no one is particularly malnourished in Death Trash. That’s not to say that survival is simple, but that this feels like a powerful metaphor on our parasitic nature and the ills of excessive consumption, especially when it takes on such a cannibalistic edge.

Eat more flesh

Unless you’re particularly dexterous and careful, you can’t quite avoid indulging in this meat feast too. In fact, you’ll end up stuffing tons of this strange flesh into your mouth hole throughout your journey, since its healing properties are quite unparalleled. Got shot in the guts with a shotgun? Eat some meat. Got smashed in the face with a hammer? Eat more meat. Got a slight scrap from being attacked by the wriggling, fleshy worms? Kill them, and then eat their meat. It’s a macabre experience, but it’s also this setting that makes Death Trash’s gritty, pixelated hellscape so remarkably bizarre and irresistible.

In essence, Death Trash is a grimy RPG that resemble the battered wastelands of early Fallout games. You’re an outlaw who’ve just been ejected from a clandestine community due to an unknown illness, and have to fight for your survival on the surface of the planet Nexus. Like a hapless newborn, you’re simply dropped into this depressing new world after a short tutorial on navigating around the map and some basic drills on self-defense: you can shoot shit up, or clobber other shit with big melee weapons. Or both.

This setup in Death Trash isn’t all that novel; it still features the same trappings of most classic RPGs after all. There are stats to increase, experience points to collect, an assortment of equipment to outfit yourself with, and a handy variety of ways to kill crusty meatbags around you. Conversations, meanwhile, are straightforward and occasionally hints at the universe’s macabre origins, although some dialogue options are surprisingly delightful—like the capacity to sacrifice a follower to fleshy abominations in one instance. There are also additional skills you can assign more points to, from bartering to specialising in hi-tech weaponry. It’s very enjoyable to tinker about in this system, but it’s also very familiar. While Death Trash is not particularly original in this aspect, this well-worn framework is well-suited to the rigours of its world.

Till there’s nothing left

But what’s most sacrosanct to Death Trash is freedom: it wants you to believe you can do whatever you want. Talk your way out of combat if you like. Adopt a vow of non-violence and avoid all enemy encounters. Walk away from conversations just to be an asshole. It’s a fun little gimmick, but it’s hardly universal—I would love to attempt a conversation with some of the fleshy, mutated folks living in the map’s far-flung corners, but they’re more inclined to kill me instead—and it’s rarely what defines the game’s best moments. Instead it’s the rancid universe itself that is rife with memorable anecdotes, and which are a joy to unravel. In one instance, I ran into a man who claimed that his eyes were stolen by robots, and have asked for my help to get them back. The solution is deceptively simple: just decimate all the machines in the building and search their remains. However, the man insisted on tagging along for the slaughter too, since he has a shotgun, but unaccustomed to his blindness, he wound up endangering both of us. It’s a hilarious and altogether unexpected twist, built upon one of the same premise that Fallout seems to be sold on: that its smaller, self-contained events are infinitely more interesting than the main journey.

As an Early Access title, Death Trash is still incomplete, with a few more chapters still in development and waiting to be unveiled. But even then, it’s a game that’s incredibly easy to sink your teeth into. Its backdrop of debauchery, monster flesh and body horror, while not altogether foreign, conjures a compelling image of humankind in a parasitic relationship with our post-apocalyptic host. We often hear of hostile worlds that want to kill us, but not so much of civilisations that are slowly and literally devouring the planet, as they rip apart the still-breathing planet muscle by muscle. Death Trash shows us that our insatiable hunger makes us the biggest threat, even as the world is in the throes of death.",Death Trash Review (Early Access)

7 Flawed but fascinating

The Vale: Shadow of the Crown is a game you could finish with your eyes closed. Much like A Blind Legend, it’s designed from the ground up with visual accessibility in mind. There aren’t fancy graphics, or much graphics at all. Instead, you’ll have to navigate the fantastical Kingdom of Glades by relying on your ears and wits—and hopefully a decent pair of headphones.

You play as Alexandra, a princess who’s blind from birth and second in line for the throne. After the death of your father, you’re sent to ward over a small keep, far from the capital. But en route, your caravan is attacked, and you’re forced to sneak and fight and smuggle your way back to safe lands.

The Vale does have some basic visuals. Simple particle effects float across the screen, giving you a sense of direction as you move, and they thin out if you start wandering away from the action. But these effects aren’t necessary by any means; I found I could play the game without even looking at the screen. Even navigating the pause menu is possible, with each item read aloud as you navigate through them.

Relying on ears

Exploring the game’s world this way is uncommon among video games. It might have proven overwhelming or difficult in a more complicated title, but The Vale keeps things simple. The sounds of a roaring waterfall that you’ve used to navigate through a cave will fade away once you enter combat, letting you focus on the enemy’s movements. Your weapons and armour have stats, adding depth to an otherwise simple combat system, but that’s about as complicated as The Vale ever gets. It’s a streamlined take on role-playing games, but I found myself enjoying it. Every aspect of the game feels like it was designed with non-visual gameplay in mind.

There’s a lot that works here. It’s quite linear, but The Vale manages to balance scripted sequences with interactive ones well. The dialogue felt well-written, too, and while the voice acting is a little grandiose and overdone at times, it fits with the fantasy setting, and I found myself enjoying the tone it set. Similarly, the controls, while awkward at times, are simple—and I suspect designed in a way that keeps everything within reach without requiring much fumbling. But without the ability to rebind keys, I found myself sticking with a controller, since navigating with the keyboard just felt a little too uncomfortable. Likewise, while I was excited by the prospect of a game I’d be able to navigate entirely by ear, I found it difficult to make progress without a pair of headphones.

Accessibility is crucial

The Vale feels like a game with a crystal clear goal: designed to be accessible to people with low or no vision, and it doesn’t compromise on that. Menus are read aloud as you navigate through them, and there’s no option to disable that voiceover. Combat is entirely based on audio cues, which works well unless you’re hearing impaired (or just want to listen to something else in the background). There aren’t even subtitles, an absence that makes sense in the game’s context, but also feels odd, given that’s one of the most common accessibility features these days.

It almost feels silly to criticise such a deliberately accessible game for lacking these features, but I did find myself missing them because I like having subtitles enabled. I like being able to rebind controls. These are accessibility features, yes, but accessibility features aren’t just used by people who need them—in the past, I’ve enabled some because I need to (since my vision is quite terrible), and others because they just felt like quality of life features. The last thing I want to do is nitpick this game for not being accessible enough in every conceivable way, especially when I probably wouldn’t have thought to do the same if I was reviewing the latest release in a major franchise. But these features aren’t just accessibility features, and I did feel their absence while playing through the game.

At the same time, though, I’m prepared to accept that those just aren’t part of the experience—in much the same way that I can accept clunky design in a classic game from the nineties. Because The Vale is very much an experience, and it’s one I found interesting, even if it felt a little frustrating at times. The truth is, there just aren’t many games like this, and The Vale’s innovative take on accessible gameplay made it worth overlooking its flaws. It’s not perfect, but it’s interesting, and I’ll choose that over perfect every time.",The Vale: Shadow of The Crown Review

9 Confident, uncanny, beautiful

60s counter culture believed through enough love, music and mind expansion, they’d achieve peace in their lifetime. Then some siphoned off to the Charles Manson family to start a race war, and many more joined the F.B.I. to do something similar.

Transcendence, art and making out do not have inherent political affiliations. That Woodstock and the Civil Rights Movement overlapped had less to do with natural sequences, and more like one of those coinkydink summers where Armageddon and Deep Impact came out, moments history books will describe as ‘big into asteroids!’ Watching your movement fracture into the very pain you imagined preventing is, for lack of a better term, a bummer. A curse that comes for many. Even the Psychonauts.

I’ve never been to Shakedown Street but I have been playing video games for too long. Generations ago it felt like a rebellious community. Defining a growing medium as its own unique space to explore intimacy, atmosphere and technology. Grounds to stand against gatekeepers, senators and Florida attorneys crusading against them. Now games are one of the most persuasive routes to a young reactionary right, who troll against human rights all hours of the day. All these to say it has been a long 20 years since the first Psychonauts released. It was a game I played most of in one sitting at a friend’s place. The genesis of not only video games, but independent games and the stature of Double Fine founder Tim Schafer, have grown to represent various things over time.

When we first met Razputin Aquato (or Raz for short) he was a rosy cheeked, green eared runaway sneaking into Whispering Rock, a summer camp and training ground for adolescent psychics. He was excited to hone his fledgling psychic abilities but more excited to meet members of the Psychonauts, an agency of psychic spies whose exploits are published in pulp comics. In Psychonauts 2, a sequel that has fought to exist, Raz finally joins their ranks (albeit as an intern). Like his first adventure, Raz must chase down conspiracies and great brain robberies. A mole has infiltrated the Psychonauts to resurrect their greatest foe. Stopping them will take Raz to the foundations of the Psychonauts, uncovering a timeline of young revolutionaries way over their heads with geopolitics.

Mental Gymnastics

Double Fine has always been a creative studio but so many of their games are shy of greatness. The level of craft in Psychonauts 2 crystalises their strengths. Ambitious ideas and (ideally) the resources to manifest them. Bundling as many gags and high concept scenarios together like an alchemist’s tight five. Dog pile combat and distinctive powers don’t gel nicely, but options to minimise fight sequences signal a game that would rather be played than wrestled with.

Hub worlds, especially the abandoned “Questionable Area” tourist trap, are large and ornate playgrounds. Packed with heights to explore, secret passages, rewarding details and obstacles to exercise Raz’ circus upbringing and brain powers. Psychonauts 2’s level design betrays a team with some strong love for a Disneyland ride queue.

Most of the game is set within various characters’ psyches. Levels revolve around repairing mindscapes, dream-like environments that radically transform when provoked. These stages oscillate between sobering reflections on addiction, dejection, despair to the most glorious commitment to gross-out humour since Earthworm Jim. The opening stage, a cove of teeth, gums and braces, is one of the most viscerally foul things I’ve encountered in a video game. Another level is set in a mouldy bowling shoe. Rank and extremely refreshing. Then you’re tackled with an extraordinary chapter exploring sensory overload and panic attacks in a situation so alien, existential and J.G. Ballardian that it accomplishes the unthinkable: a Beatles parody that doesn’t come off as tacky.

Feed Your Head

Raz enters the Psychonauts only to find himself back on the bottom of the pecking order. Briefly. The game’s focus swiftly changes to the struggles of Raz’ heroes: the founders of the Psychonauts. Above all else Raz’ mentor Ford Cruller. Cruller, til now a zany, bacon-loving coot, turns out to be a broken man hiding underneath layers of eccentricity. The entire founding team of Psychonauts are frozen between fears of the past and future, burrowing deeper into their own minds. A facade of superheroic hippies hiding wounded dreamers and misfits in a bureau that blew up out of their daytripping.

The first Psychonauts had Raz repair brains suffering from the broadest sweeps of ‘crazy’. This story puts Raz in the backseat of his own adventure, but focused on older characters riddled with realer, specific regrets, which makes for a more interesting game.

It’s tempting to overanalyse where the minds of Double Fine are at 20 years in. Veterans of video gamedom’s silliest shops now being assimilated into the Microsoft family tree. Long and unexpected creative journeys play a big part in Psychonauts 2. One burnt out Psychonaut, living isolated in his personal Little Shop of Horrors, feels like an homage for puppeteer Frank Oz. A similarity that would be easier to dismiss if all the new Psychonauts characters did not look like Muppets (and by contrast the returning cast looking like those creepier nectarine skinned Dark Crystal puppets).

Psychonauts feels like a game with all hands on deck. Double Fine had sought funding through a crazy quilt of means. All those skeptical of their finances will see just what kind of glorious strange can be made with those millions. Something confident, uncanny and beautiful. Like wafts of familiar scents, moments throughout Psychonauts evoke memories of both Double Fine and LucasArts’ highest highs. Many of Double Fine’s best known collaborators, from visual artists to voice talent, have pooled in. It makes a fine game, one about the atrophy of counter culture, how bonds make finer milestones than accomplishments, and how past failures do not negate future glories. Psychonauts 2 is a rare treasure, one that feels rarer and rarer as years go by, but clearly still possible with the proper gang of weirdos.",Psychonauts 2 Review

7 Moving but messy

Road 96 isn’t exactly subtle about what it wants to say. Or more precisely, what it wishes to convey about our current political landscape.

In the game’s opening scene, you’re sitting on a bus as a lonely teenager seeking to flee a country that’s becoming increasingly authoritarian and dangerous. Its leader, Tyrak, uses disinformation and the spectre of a terrorist attack to wrap an ever-tighter iron grip on his position and the people of the fictional country of Petria. On the bus, too, are a couple in their late 20s, a sleepy old man, and a police officer named Fanny, who’s transporting a teenage prisoner after circumstances left them unable to travel in a cop car.

You didn’t initially intend to be here. You were trying to keep a low profile, riding the bus on your journey to the border to take a breather. Nevertheless, you’re dragged into the conversation by Fanny, leaving you with a few options on how to react or diffuse the situation. You can adopt a neutral tone, with dialogue options that lean towards democracy and an inclination for changing the country’s current right-leaning system, or rebuke the police’s uncritical enforcement of draconian policies. Hushed rumors about rebellious teenagers being ‘dealt with’ by Tyrak are thrown into the conversation by strangers around you, which only heightens the tension. Fanny instinctively dismisses this as fake news, but you see a flicker of doubt cross her face.

This all culminates in the police officer drawing her gun in a mix of anger and uncertainty, waving it frantically at everyone in a frenzied attempt to retain control over the conversation. Could she be sending this kid she arrested to her death? Could she let them go? In such an anxious state, that gun could be fired with just one wrong move, or one wrong interjection into the conversation.

Your actions throughout these opening moments decide how Fanny deals with the teen, and your own fate.

Running From the State

If you hadn’t guessed, this procedurally-generated road trip to the border is not-so-subtly a reference to the growing political divisions that have dominated American politics ever since a certain orange-faced billionaire ran for president. This real-life political uncertainty has been transformed by developer DigixArt into a story where you trek through the wilderness to the country’s border, in hope of an escape from the tyranny and divisiveness of life in Petria. The ‘procedurally-generated’ aspect of the game takes the form of the fleeting interruptions to your adventure by one of the game’s supporting cast. As the unnamed teenager, you’ll occasionally run into an eclectic group of individuals holding vastly different ideologies and political beliefs, as their lives are transformed by the country’s fractured existence.

The more time you spent in Petria, you’ll meet people like the so-called trucker acting for another cause behind the wheel named John, the police officer you’ve previously met named Fanny, a right-wing talk-show host styled after Alex Jones named Sonya, a disillusioned kid named Zoe escaping a family whose political beliefs are diametrically different to her own, and more. In these brief moments you’ll make decisions that change their lives and the lives of Petria. And everything from when, where, and under what circumstances you meet these people is randomised, matching the game’s story with a roguelike uniqueness to each journey to the border.

As you take your first steps from the open road to the border as several teens seeking a life of freedom, your paths intertwine with these people, often as they find their ideas and humanity challenged–and even more so once they learn the truth beyond the propaganda. As these teenagers, you seek passage over Petria’s border to escape the country. If its real-life allusions weren’t obvious enough, the despotical Tyrak has even built a wall to prevent people from leaving Petria.

The result is an experience about a nation crumbling under its own weight, as you gradually uncover the truth of the past and unravel how Tyrak seized power. You may even influence the future of Petria through your actions by encouraging the people you meet to act for change, whether that be through the ballot box or by revolution.

No single, right answer

When a nation is driven by corruption and power at the cost of its people’s way of life, what direction should you take? This is where Road 96 both thrives and falters. Although the game gives you the ability to act in your own self-interest, as a catalyst for democratic change or to fuel a revolution, the way the game treats these choices implies a single, correct answer in how events should unravel.

When Donald Trump left power at the beginning of 2021, he was replaced by a Democrat in Joe Biden, who maintained many of the same policies on immigration, war and police brutality despite being framed as the man who would fix the mistakes of his predecessor. However, protestors who had picketed the streets about kids in cages, racial injustice and inequality during Trump’s presidency are happier to turn the other way with a friendlier face in charge. So just as Road 96 wishes to transplant Trump’s problems onto Petria, it similarly fails to consider whether the nation’s problems are solely the cause of the tyrant-in-charge, or something that runs much deeper.

In every encounter, your conversations can tip the scales towards the naive, simplistic idea that electing the person in blue will cause the person in red to disappear and fix everything–another obvious reference to the American two-party political system. In other words, the wall will go if Tyrak goes! Just as many blamed Trump alone for a system that empowered him, Road 96 places the blame for the fictional atrocities in Petria at the sole discretion of a single individual. The game even suggests that the nation can have a get-out-of-jail-free card if they would elect the kind politician who says the right thing. It’s an option that may tangibly work in a game that gave greater consideration to the nation’s history, but we never learn more of Petria before the terrorist attack in 1986 that emboldened Tyrak’s dictatorial reign.

Even as real-life examples challenged this assumption, democratic decisions were presented by the characters around you as a neutral or positive move, while a radical solution was met with caution even by the game’s in-game radicals. My decisions skewed this direction, but I couldn’t help but feel the game was reluctant in allowing me to follow this path. This is only compounded by how each decision is placed not at the hands of any in-game character, instead challenging the political beliefs of the player directly. Each teenager you control in successive journeys to the border is designed to be a faceless vessel for player actions rather than their own character, so there’s no separation between the decisions made by your in-game character and the player pulling the strings.

Procedural Magic

This depersonalised protagonist is a symptom of the procedural system, albeit one that’s easily forgiven when you realise how unique each journey is. While certain character beats are set in stone, the when, where and how of these events is at the behest of player actions, which make every player’s journey unique. While an impressive technical feat, it isn’t perfect.

You occasionally have moments wherein you’ve met a character before on your journey, then encounter them again with dialogue that fails to register the connection. In one run to the border, I helped John sober up and chatted with him about his concerns for the country, with the next scene placing me alongside a tech genius named Alex, who’s searching for information about his birth parents. This scene saw me work with Alex to help John broadcast illegal messages on the radio, but John did not seem to have recognised me from our previous encounter; he referred to me as a stranger and not the person who helped him just hours earlier.

Even with some messy execution on its political themes, Road 96 succeeds at capturing a fractious journey on the road and the turmoil of modern American politics. A deeper exploration of Petria’s history may give more context to the game’s narrative of taking change of your own destiny. But without this background, it ends up oversimplifying its premise by positing that the only barrier to equity and justice is a strongman in a suit.

In reality, injustice runs far deeper.",Road 96 Review

5 Perplexing and inaccessible

Developer Antab Studio’s Foreclosed is a captivating third-person shooter. Told entirely in a cel-shaded comic book aesthetic, paying homage to classic video games like the 1995 beat ‘em up Comix Zone, Foreclosed puts a lot of stock in its look. Maybe a bit too much. Like some pageant queens on RuPaul’s Drag Race, this action-adventure game relies on pretty, hooking you in with its preference for style. There’s nothing wrong with being a looker, but Foreclosed’s rigid controls and staunch lack of accessibility options prove that beauty can often belie many underdeveloped elements.

You play as Evan Kapnos, a governmental operative (or something like that) whose entire identity has been foreclosed. His employer, SecurTech, went bankrupt. As a result, Kapnos loses access to everything in a matter of seconds: his rickety apartment, his brain-implanted I.D. (because this is a cyberpunk game), his money, his fucking gun! And what happens when the bureaucracy infringes on even a video game character’s Second Amendment rights?

Lots of violence with an undocumented weapon, of course, as Kapnos goes on a killing spree to reinstate his identity. However, as things often do, nothing goes as planned, and Kapnos finds himself engulfed in a spiraling conspiracy about defrauding the government.

Shooting Through Nondescript Sponges

The narrative deals with deep subject matter revolving around bureaucratic interests and oligarchical hierarchies. It also has something to say about capitalists exploiting loopholes to extract as much money as possible by avoiding taxes and killing “legally.” This is a dense-ass game. It’s easy to get stumped by Foreclosed’s storytelling, what with names and events tossed around without proper context. Despite all of its philosophical musing on money superseding humanity (much like it already does and always has), Foreclosed is mostly a mediocre shooter filled with nondescript sponges.

Every enemy, from one two-piece suit-wearing dude to the next, looks identical to each other. Whatever differences exist between them are minor at best. Like, one guy might wear a blue helmet and blue body armor instead of a blue blazer, while another uses a blue energy shield in conjunction with the blue armor. Foreclosed’s enemies are the blandest worker bees ever assembled.

Though insipid in design, the enemies are memorable: They eat bullets. Kapnos’ pistol, which can be upgraded with perks like exploding bullets or increased fire rate, is too weak. So you’re often putting 10 or more bullets in these dudes even after applying any three of the available six perks. And because you can’t take nearly as much damage as these administrative goons, and you’re usually outnumbered anyway, Foreclosed devolves into an exhausting shooting gallery full of superabsorbent bullet sponges with incredible accuracy. Be prepared to die a lot in this game.

Fun Powers, Frustrating Settings, Flat Parts

That’s not to say there’s no fun here. While enemies take a while to kill, one well-placed headshot usually does the trick. You can wipe out an entire area in moments if you’re efficient with your trigger finger. Kapnos also has access to telekinesis and other powers (such as beacons that siphon health and cages that trap henchmen). These abilities make for some great action sequences. Combining them together, like levitating one dude to fill him with bullets while caging another to stop them from shooting as you siphon health from yet another, feels brutal. When using everything at your disposal, enemies typically have no recourse other than their numbers. And the heat management of your various powers.

But what adds to the exhaustive nature of Foreclosed’s action, aside from the annoying amount of guys to shoot, is its controls. It’s hard finding a smooth balance with aiming, as it can swing wildly from rigid to loose in the settings. And the settings itself are the barest of bones. There are no accessibility options to adjust things like color contrast or text size either. There is an aim assist, though, a boon for players with physical limitations. But since this is rendered in that striking cel-shaded comic book style, having no options to make changes to its appearance impacted my ability to see things.

Then you get to Foreclosed’s other parts: the puzzling and the sneaking. Puzzles in this game, largely made up of “find the key to the lock” design in which you must locate a specific terminal to unlock a specific door (for example), are fine. They don’t reinvent the wheel when it comes to puzzle-solving; they merely exist as another mediocre element. But the stealth is terrible. It’s the kind where you insta-fail if you’re caught, where you’re spotted despite hiding behind structures. Thankfully, checkpoints are gracious during these sections, making them tolerable—even though the AI is hella accurate.

Still, the story, while occasionally perplexing, is full of heady material to chew through. It’s the kind of narrative that would require an additional playthrough, totally possible thanks to its roughly 2-4 hour campaign with selectable chapters.

7 Encyclopedic, thematically hefty

Svoboda 1945: Liberation is a game which explores how looking back at the past means different things for different groups of people. It’s a story about the difference between those who benefit from the act of looking back, and those who are punished and aggrieved instead.

It’s an adventure game employing full motion video and hand-drawn art to tell the story of a historical society volunteer visiting Svoboda, a small village on the Czech-German border, in order to decide whether an old schoolhouse there deserves to be made into a landmark and saved from demolition. It’s also a chronicle of the region’s tumultuous and complex history, of the Czech Republic’s role in World War II, particularly along its border with Germany.

In practice, the game’s adventure game framework often takes a back seat to its encyclopedic, history-documenting one. While your protagonist certainly plays a personal role in the game’s narrative, their primary duty is as fact finder, as absorber of dates, people and places. A townsperson you’re interviewing might leave in a huff at a rude question, or slam the door in your face, but they will usually immediately open it again, artificially available to serve as history-imparting vessels.

Historical research

And there is a ton of history to be found here. Even to those knowledgeable about the major events of the second World War, Svoboda’s geographical particularities will likely introduce numerous new names and faces to anyone without strong familiarity with the area. Players are introduced to Czechia’s Revolutionary Guard, its kulak farmers, its Volhynian Czechs; all groups with deep ties to the country and its history, who were all brought to Svoboda, drawn together by greater political forces, while needing to navigate and survive intensely personal ones. Playing the game provides important witness to the often overshadowed history of the Czech Republic during WWII and afterwards.

Still, Svoboda goes to great lengths to show us that the same history which is set in stone for one group of people might appear as heretical rubbish to another. Everyone in town who you speak to has their own ghosts from the war, whispering in their ears. Everyone has their own banner, their own household to defend, their own stories to honor. The war was a knife dug deep into the heart of the country, and the remaining residents of Svoboda are left to deal with the many festering injuries from that old wound.

Distorted identities

Svoboda shows us that a town can have an identity, and that that identity can become distorted and confused through trauma. Before WWII, Germans and Czechs coexisted in Svoboda. But living through occupation, anti-semetic purges and death marches took its inevitable toll. The Germans who remained after liberation day were like a miserable hangover, a reminder of everything that the Czech people suffered. And so they were driven out. Strangers from inland Czechia came to take their places, themselves resented by Svoboda’s surviving inhabitants for being gifted all that free land. A few years later, a communist government took over, causing even greater transformations and social disruption before disappearing along with the USSR in the late eighties.

The town you visit during the events of the game feels thoroughly spun around and dissociated by its tumultuous history. The school you are tasked with reviewing is itself threatened by the greedy capitalistic intentions of the town’s resident landlord. Yet there is lasting disdain for the country’s collectivist, communist past. A German expellee returns to her birthplace while others in the town refuse to display any guilt about her being driven away. An old jewish man cleans a swastika off of his grandparent’s tombstone. A mayor mourns her father’s losses, caused by the same government which she now encapsulates. All practically anyone can agree on is that the past should be forgotten, that the future is all that is left.

A past without a future

But how can there be a future without ground to seed and grow it from? Everyone you interview in the game is old, their minds and spirits still ensnared by half-century-old events. Svoboda itself is crumbling and decrepit. If its timeline has a terminus, you’re standing at it. If you decide to save the school building, the old teacher, Studnička, will turn it into a museum. There’s no indication though that anyone will continue his work after he has passed on. Who will tend the graves and keep them clean of hateful markings after Hein is gone? Who will remember the names on the photographs you carry after Jánský, the last proof of his expelled German family’s ties to the land, dies? What does it mean for a town which refuses to look at its painful past to also have no future?

In one flashback set in the late 1940s, on the eve of communist takeover, four men play blackjack around a table. The men exchange their hopes and their dreams, their fears and regrets. Despite everything–the war, the displacements, the retaliatory violence–they still mostly look toward the future as something full of promise, of possibility. But one by one, each man folds his hand and retires for the night. Because in the town of Svoboda, as in cards, someone has to lose just as surely as someone has to win. At least until tomorrow comes.",Svoboda 1945: Liberation Review

8 Nostalgic joy

Dodgeball Academia hits several nostalgic beats in the opening hours. Its bright, cheerful aesthetic is reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon I would have watched religiously in my youth, and frequently borrows from the Pokemon games in numerous ways— not only do your opponents spot you from afar, the battle and infirmary music are pleasingly familiar and the simple act of catching a dodgeball sounds similar to a Poke Ball opening. However, even though these references and nods are plain to see, developer Pocket Trap has crafted a sports RPG that is memorable in its own right.

You play as Otto, a kind-hearted boy who heads to the titular Dodgeball Academia with ambitions of becoming the greatest dodgeball player of all time. After arriving a tad late to the opening ceremony, however, his powers are promptly awakened by touching a glowing dodgeball that has sat, perpetually spinning, in a slab of rock since a dodgeball-centric war.

It is utterly absurd. But it is also done with a knowing nod that makes its premise endearing rather than ridiculous. Throughout your journey to win the big school tournament, you meet a cute cast of characters who are delightfully written, even if their stories are rarely surprising. And sure, their personalities are often well-worn tropes, but the humour is so goofy and fun that you will likely love every single one of them—even the villains. Whether it’s Boris’ insistence on being viewed as a tough guy or Chester’s need to remind everyone he’s the smartest person in the room, they all raise a smile or earn a chuckle.

These characteristics are cemented further by wonderfully expressive designs and animations. Otto’s first and best pal Balloony will deflate their head whenever they are upset, making you want to offer them a consoling hug. Elsewhere, Mina, another teammate, will whoop and holler whenever you win a match so passionately you can hear her victory cry, even though the game has no voice acting.

Adora-ball

Outside of meeting these quirky individuals, you will engage in a spot of dodgeball. The game’s affable aesthetic might imply this would be a fairly straightforward segment, but it actually boasts a surprising amount of depth. Of course, the aim is simple, lob balls at your opponents until their roster’s health hits zero. At a basic level, this tests your reactions, with good timing required to catch or hit the ball back at your opponent.

But beyond that, there are elemental balls to contend with that can inflict status conditions such as burns or even slow your movement speed. Not every character throws the ball the same way either. Some may toss a slow ball that gathers pace over time, whilst others can perform physic-bending shots that see the ball following an erratic, spiralling flight path. It all serves to keep you on your toes, demanding that you adjust your timing to defend against incoming threats.

On top of that, each character possesses a powerful Balltimate ability. For your team, that can be Otto’s powerful beam that damages your opponents or Balloony’s healing pool that they lay on the ground. As for your opponent’s, this usually results in a volley of balls flying in your direction, bullet hell shooter style, that you’ll either need to acrobatically dodge or repeatedly nail the timing for a catch or counter. This, alongside all of the aforementioned features, see the matches becoming incredibly hectic and exhilarating at times.

Still, there is, unsurprisingly, a lot of dodgeball to be played in the game, which could have become tedious if the developers didn’t opt to include shifting rulesets. Sometimes the match is a simple 1v1, whilst others a 3v3 affair, though you’re only ever properly in control of one character at a time. Beyond that, in some rounds, when one of your opponent’s HP hits zero, they will move behind you on the court, picking up loose throws and hurling them your way, meaning you’ll need to keep a close eye on both directions. They’re subtle adjustments, but they definitely keep that feeling of unwanted repetition at bay.

Don’t get deflated

The only issue with the bouts of dodgeball is that you don’t know which ruleset is in effect for each match. You see, you can put on various equipment to adjust your stats, and it would have been nice to know precisely what I’d be up against so I could tweak my strategy accordingly. Similarly, certain characters worked better in specific conditions. If the match looked like a war of attrition, I’d want Balloony’s healing prowess, whereas, for a shorter game, I might opt for more firepower.

There’s also some inconsistency in difficulty. The game is split into eight separate days, with the main quest focusing on classes and tournament matches. As you roll between mission objectives, your classmates will challenge you to battles if you cross their line of sight, much like in Pokemon. These particular bouts tend to be incredibly easy compared to the story matches, often only lasting mere seconds before you move on to the next section. In contrast, some quest-based games are noticeably trickier, most notably in the middle section. However, the wobbly difficulty doesn’t take away from the fun. It is just a little jarring on occasion.

For the most part, though, Dodgeball Academia is an unbridled joy with a lovely cast of wholesome characters, even though the narrative isn’t always that fresh. If it was merely fun and silly writing alone, I’d still thoroughly enjoy my time with it because it reminds me fondly of excitedly waking up on a Saturday to watch daft cartoons and play video games—back to simpler times. The fact that the act of playing dodgeball is also fantastic is a warmly welcomed bonus.",Dodgeball Academia Review

7 Challenging but exciting

Norse mythology has been a favourite theme of indie games’ in recent years, with a whole host of different takes on the setting. Games like Bad North turn Viking invasions into a roguelite tower defence, whereas recent titles like Valheim let us live out a survival fantasy, trying to establish a humble homestead while fending off mythical creatures with our friends.

Tribes of Midgard is a mix of both. You drop into a procedurally generated Norse realm filled with all sorts of monsters, biomes, and treasures to uncover, but there’s a catch: you must defend your settlement and a mythical tree known as the Seed of Yggdrasil, as every night monsters will come to destroy it. Either on your lonesome, or with up to nine other players, you have to build up your defences, gather resources, and upgrade vendors to turn yourselves into powerful Viking heroes.

It reminds me of Don’t Starve in some ways: days are short, nights are long, and there is never quite enough time to do everything. The key difference though, is that no matter how big the world is in Tribes of Midgard, you are bound to your settlement, and must return every night to defend the tree. You can unlock shrines that allow you to teleport around the map, gaining quick access to certain areas, vendors, and random events that occur across the realm, but exploration did feel somewhat stifled by the relentless day/night cycle.

Two distinct halves

This almost makes me wish the game had an endless day mode, because defending the tree isn’t the most compelling aspect of the game; instead, it was exploring the map. In fact, Tribes of Midgard feels like a game made up of two distinct parts: the open-world adventure aspect of picking up a weapon and diving into its world to fight monsters, find treasure, and gather resources in the day; versus the tower defence elements of defending the Seed of Yggdrasil against invaders at night. Both, however, feel like they conflict with one another at times, their individual demands and goals disrupting each other’s potential.

The Soul economy is a great example. In Tribes of Midgard, you get souls from everything, and souls are used for everything, whether that’s upgrading vendors or building structures. But you also have to use this resource to heal the Seed of Yggdrasil, which loses health at a continuous rate, or when attacked during the night. I understand the need to use souls as a means of upgrading vendors, but feeding them to the tree just to keep going feels grindy, especially as souls drop at a fairly pitiful rate apart from when you kill bigger foes like a Jötunn.

In comparison to defending the settlement, fighting monsters like the towering Jötunn is by far the best part of Tribes of Midgard. These lumbering bosses invade your realm and you have to hunt them down in the wild as they approach, but the type of Jötunn you face is random. There are Jötunn made of ice, Jötunn that summon evil spirits, fire Jötunn, and Jötunn that turn into hurricanes. You never know which flavour you’re going to fight, and that’s a big part of the fun.

Tribes of Midgard’s crafting system also facilitates play seamlessly—it’s easy to gather resources and your inventory seems almost limitless in this regard. When you return to your settlement, simply whack your haul in the chest and it can be used with any of the vendors. Though the equipment menu isn’t on-screen as with Don’t Starve, it doesn’t take long to sort weapons, armour, and potions either. There are also useful hotkeys for switching between equipped items.

Two ways to play

Tribes of Midgard is a difficult game, but this can be mitigated depending on which of its two modes you play. Saga is a fixed challenge, a set series of goals you must accomplish over a number of cycles in order to triumph. Survival, on the other hand, is an endless mode where you can tweak elements of the world and thus the experience. This is far better if you just want to explore, or aren’t really enjoying the game’s challenges, especially if you’re going at it solo. But even then, Tribes of Midgard isn’t especially well balanced towards single players; you’ll get by in combat well enough, but it’s far harder from a souls and resource gathering perspective.

And that kind of sums up Tribes of Midgard. Its world, art-style, exploration, and hack-n-slash combat are super fun, but these feel hampered by Tribes of Midgard’s key conceit as a tough tower defence game. Increasingly long nights mean you get little and less time to explore, and this is exacerbated by growing demands on resources. Instead, Tribes of Midgard would have made a better open-world game—its procedurally-generated Norse realm is so explorable. I would gladly play Tribes of Midgard more if I wasn’t bound to the settlement as much, and I hope that’s a mode that could be explored in the future.",Tribes of Midgard Review

8 Cosy and charming

Last Stop is a character-driven sci-fi adventure that finds its footing in great storytelling and strong direction. Interactivity comes in the form of quick-time events, trivial dialogue choices and fixed walking paths that often disrupt the story’s flow, rather than enriching it. While the game doesn’t break new grounds to redefine interactive storytelling, there’s tempered success in its clever and captivating narrative delivery.

Set in a fictional borough in London, Last Stop follows three characters in isolated tales as their lives fall into disarray by a supernatural event. London is brought to life through vibrant 3D art direction that gorgeously depict its lively high streets, lush green parks and snugly packed neighborhoods. A variety of cinematic angles are used to pan through the game’s scenic imagery that elevate its visual storytelling. Topping things off is the splendid orchestral soundtrack that colours the ambience of every scene.

However, aside from the occasional prompt and prodding characters along lengthy walking scenes, there’s not much to do other than sit back and watch the story play out. While I appreciate how quick-time events are choreographed to relate to each character, they feel forced, serving more as obstructions rather than adding any sort of nuance to its tale. Walking scenes, for instance, last way longer than they should, and use fixed camera angles that haphazardly switch perspectives from behind a character for a few steps, to in front of them, making you fumble to quickly adjust the direction so characters will keep walking smoothly. It interrupts conversations and mars what would otherwise have been unruffled, mellow banter between them.

A mystery at the centre of it all

Fortunately, the tale still unravels with a well-paced plot, likable cast, an intriguing mystery and acutely placed cliffhangers that keep you engrossed till the end. The narrative hits its stride early on by establishing an underlying mystery in its prologue; a portal has appeared in the depths of the London Underground. From there you advance the story by playing through the perspectives of three seemingly unconnected characters in separate arcs till they ultimately converge.

More effort is put into telling a good story with effective use of familiar cinematic tropes. We have John Smith, a downtrodden middle-aged public council worker who finds himself in a Freaky Friday situation when a turn of events sees him body swap with his neighbor Jack Smith—a younger, fitter and more care-free individual. Elsewhere in London, Meena Hughes, a relentlessly ambitious ex-spy and certified badass, struggles to find gratification in her new placement at a desk job. And finally there’s Donna Adeleke, a teenager looking to sidestep family responsibilities in favour of goofing around with her best mates, Becky and Vivek, when a seemingly harmless late night excursion turns into an accidental abduction.

Not so meticulous

Variable State uses all tools at their disposal to ramp up the adventure. However, there’s a few things the game glances over to maintain its meticulous grip over how the story unfolds. Curious details and relevant social commentary are tucked in the backdrop, but their nuances aren’t fully explored. The cast looks wonderfully diverse, representing the immigrant population of London, but they all more or less sound like a variation of an archetypical English person with no trace of cultural diversity. In one story arc, there’s a character who develops empathetic video games at an indie studio where crunch culture is enforced, which prompts him to quit on the spot, but that’s all there is to it: the game simply makes a blanket statement about how crunch is bad, without adding more to the conversation.

Yet there’s enough of a twist to familiar archetypes that makes Last Stop’s characters and their seemingly predictable development come into their own. The story smartly and aptly cycles through perspectives in each chapter, which keeps the plot moving. Just when things seem to slow down, the story interjects new twists to shake it up, adding further tensions between characters or teasing a reveal to entice you to keep playing. This is boosted even more by the splendid voice acting that lends depth and authenticity to the characters. John’s soft-spoken nature is captured in the calm delivery of his lines, while Meena’s clipped dialogues and firm tone showcase her shrewd and calculating personality.

Then there’s the staggered episodic structure, which works well too. Do you want to continue with a dangling mystery from a previous chapter, or delve into a new perspective to keep things fresh? While you’ll still follow a tightly-knit linear narrative, you’ll also retain some control over the order in which you experience these chapters, which helps keep the story from feeling stale. Each episode is paced well, efficiently prodding the plot along without overstaying its welcome.

Engrossing finale

Eventually, these loosely connected tales intertwine to form a thoroughly entertaining finale. The characters are thrown into a tricky situation that tests their mettle, and we get to see how much they’ve grown through their individual journeys. And towards the final sequence, you get to make the only choice of any consequence in the game, and that’s to determine the fates of John, Meena and Donna. That said, it’s not as affecting or potent as it sounds, with the epilogues falling a little flat. For me, watching these characters navigate their messy circumstances and seeing their growth in the final act felt more powerful than the afterword.

Last Stop isn’t perfect. Its limited and tepid interactivity makes it better suited as a TV show, but I can’t deny that the story is entertaining and absorbing enough where, in the grand scheme of things, its shortcomings didn’t matter much. It took me back to the days of charming British sci-fi tv shows like Blake 7, Doctor Who and Torchwood, where these shows shared a love of telling character-driven stories on a backdrop of big themes despite budget constraints. With its intimate cast of characters, eccentric English charm and cosy story-telling, Last Stop replicates these shows’ charisma, creating an enjoyable sci-fi tale that’s gripping and one you’ll want to see through to the end.",Last Stop Review

6 Increasingly diminished returns

Chernobylite is a game of interesting choices held back by a deeply irritating loop. Yet, it’s through that very cycle that their consequences are revealed. And, just as often, undone.

Players take on the role of Igor, a Russian scientist searching for his long-lost fiancée, Tatyana, in the irradiated Zone (the capital “Z” is intentional) surrounding the Chernobyl disaster. Chernobylite cribs heavily from Stalker narratively, aesthetically and mechanically. Expect plenty of ashen buildings, fields barren except for the herbs and mushrooms you need to mix healing salves, and radiation damage digging a red trough in your health bar. Igor is a stalker and you will run into mysterious enemies called Black Stalkers, too.

This dark first-person survival game from developer The Farm 51, newly out of Early Access, is not especially original. In this post-apocalyptic setting, you will scavenge for supplies to keep your weapons loaded and your companions well-fed, venture out into the Zone to complete missions and find clues to Tatyana’s whereabouts, sneak through the tall grass and shoot dudes in the head. As you find materials, you can put them toward building new equipment in your base, like a weaponsmith for fabricating guns and gardens to grow necessary plants. The shooting is fine. The base-building is fine. Chernobylite, in general, feels fine enough on a moment-to-moment basis.

War-time routines

Yet it’s in Chernobylite’s approach to progression that it goes beyond familiarity. Here the game hints at the significance of friends and partners in establishing a meaningful routine. When you level up, you earn skill points. But instead of pulling up a menu and allocating them to your stats, you need to wait until you return to your base. Once the mission is complete and you’re safe and sound, you can speak to one of your companions and ask them to train you. From there, your companion will literally put you through training. During a session to upgrade my precision, my companion had me lean around some boxes to shoot a stack of cans. In another stealth training section, my companion tasked me with sneaking up on him through the tall grass. This is a really smart approach to leveling that ties narrative and gameplay together, reinforcing the idea that you and your companions rely on each other.

But as you progress through Chernobylite, some design quirks become major impediments to this circuit of progression. Most of my frustration comes from the way it handles death and respawning. Each time you die, the game treats it as if Igor was captured by enemy soldiers. As such, after each death, you’re transported to a mostly abandoned prison where enemies stand guard. To escape, you’ll need to find your portal gun, which is stashed at a marked location on the map. None of this is especially difficult, but it means that each time you die, you’re forced to restart the mission. And before you can do so, you must first play through a tedious stealth section.

Again, this happens every time you die.

Later in the game, when I reached a mission that requires you to fight a Black Stalker—not a ridiculously hard fight, but challenging enough that if you’re battered going into it your chances of survival are significantly diminished—I died repeatedly. That means playing through the prison section, which never changes much, over and over again.

Cycles of death

But what if you fail again after being captured? Here’s when the game reveals its most interesting mechanic. After a double death, you’re transported to a walkway in an ethereal realm studded with green crystals. Here, you can spend Chernobylite—the titular currency being a crystalline reward for accomplishing key quests or exploring off the beaten path—to redo a decision you made earlier in the game. During one early mission, you have the choice to kill or spare a suspicious man who is on the run from the villainous NAR. Later, a companion reveals that this man was important to them. I sentenced this man to his death at first, but when I realised that I could spend Chernobylite to go back and spare the man for their sake, I instantly altered my past.

To be honest, I’m of two minds on this. On one hand, it’s a convenient way for busy players to see everything the game has to offer. Unlike most choice-based RPGs, you don’t need to replay the game to witness the results of different choices; your playthrough can contain multitudes. But I dislike it for the same reason that it’s superficially interesting. It flattens the importance of choice; rather than asking you to roleplay a specific character, warts and all, Chernobylite allows you to be all things to all people. Chernobylite, the material, is fairly rare, but so are the key decisions important enough that I felt any desire to reverse them. That’s why on the rare occasion that I felt compelled to seek out a do-over, it was awfully easy to turn back the clock; I already have the materials to do so.

In the end, Chernobylite felt a lot like scavenging for supplies in the Zone. There are certainly interesting things to unearth, but the laborious process of revealing them was barely worth the hassle. If Chernobylite is a loop, it is one that brings increasingly diminished returns with each completed cycle.",The Indie Game Website

6 More of the same

Grime, developed by Clover Bite, is a bit of a contradiction: it’s as much a stereotype of a modern game as it is a creative one. A difficult, Metroidvania-inspired and Dark Souls title, it boasts of a unique absorbing mechanic that distinguishes it from the moment-to-moment action of its contemporaries.

You are a being that is effectively birthed into an unformed world, filled with foul inhabitants. For the story, well, it’s one of those: something has happened or is happening, you’ll find out as you go, with the mystery unraveling itself, in cryptic, overly grandiose ways. Grime is a game that unravels its story exactly like the From Software franchise that spawned these games, as its Dark Souls-esque disconnect between you, the audience who knows nothing and the character, who appears to know exactly what’s going on in the world, but you’ll find out later.

As you play, you’ll absorb different monsters and gain abilities related to them once you’ve hunted enough of them. Every enemy will declare what attacks they’ll use, which you can retaliate by absorbing and blasting these attacks back at them. This move can nearly change the entire tide of battle in most cases, but only if you’re willing to familiarise yourself with the specific animations and timings of every minute detail in battle. At one point you’ll unlock a combo meter which builds up as you successfully absorb attacks, which just adds onto the mild stress that Grime pits you against.

Whilst it is a cool gimmick, it becomes one of those situations that makes me realise that I no longer have the patience to watch and anticipate their attacks anymore. With enemies-as-fodder or giant hands that push you away, I just wished that the game would get out of my own way and let me explore its environments instead.

The sum of its influences

Games like Death’s Door and Hollow Knight are a good example of striking that balance of exploration and air of mystery, as they demonstrate how to make their soulslike games without their mechanical brutality. These ensure that players like myself—who love their worlds, but rarely have the patience to dedicate time to overcoming their meticulous battles—can at least have a shot at completing them.

But Grime insists that you repeatedly fail to succeed. Failure itself isn’t so much of an issue due to the less punishing death cycle than most games, where you won’t lose what you’ve collected to level up. However, what you will lose is the combos to gain more Mass—the game’s currency—that you build up, which increases the more you absorb the essence of your enemies.

At the same time, trawling back through the levels is tedious, as previous encounters will reappear in the world. I wound up getting quite good at jumping over these encounters, just to speed things along.

Allt these are, in part, due to how nondescript its combat is. It’s your typical methodical rodeo; swings take time and knowing the right moment to interject with a quick jab is vital. Combat is demanding, but nothing about it, outside the boss fights, forces me to actually think on my feet.

But when the boss fights came about? Now that’s the good stuff. Colossal enemies that actively use every part of the game’s shtick to force you into beating it brought on nervous sweats a few times.

It’s a shame this spirit doesn’t carry over into the regular enemy encounters, like in its chief inspiration Dark Souls, where each monster you came up against felt like a challenge to overcome, rather than a monotonous hill to climb. A more rapid pace of action with a focus on parrying—and without the burden of the stamina meter—would have been beneficial, as you’ll often find yourself standing starkly still, since the stamina meter runs out absurdly quickly in Grime’s earliest parts.

Yet, what Grime brings to the table is its grotesque setting. The desolation and uncertainty in the world are ones that I’d rather spend more time exploring, instead of actually going through the motions of what Grime expects me to do. It’s its grim world that made me hunger for more than the game’s superficial offerings.

Only for fans

In the end, Grime’s issue is that it’s just one more action-adventure role-playing game with influences from some of the best games of the last decades. It fails to capitalise on its absorption mechanic and the wider world it presents.The various abilities and means of interaction you have with the world as the game opens up injects more variety, but there’s only you can do before it’s back to more of the same routine of hacking and slashing monsters.

In the last few years it’s become a running gag within indie circles that Metroidvania and soulslike games are the go-to genres to build your game around. Unfortunately, Grime wears that on its shoulder with pride, instead of doing anything remotely interesting. In essence, it’s the software equivalent of saying ‘only fans of the soulikes genre will enjoy this’.",The Indie Game Website

City planning made addictive

Mini Motorways is a game of precise strategy and optimisation. Your task is to draw the roads that connect a growing metropolis, linking together the same-coloured houses and building together so your little townsfolk can go to work and back home without a hitch. But while the game boasts a modernist design—it’s pure joy and satisfaction to see a sprawling network of roads and buildings of your own making, all neatly plugged into one another—what belies this elegance is an astonishingly stressful game of city planning. Fortunately, the minimalist music that tinkers in the background helps to starve off some of the anxiety.

Originally an Apple Arcade exclusive, Mini Motorways is now available on Steam for aspiring city planners. If you’re ready to tear your hair out of your follicles over the algorithm’s decision to construct a house 10 million miles away from its destination, it may very well become one of your favourite time-wasters.

Horror Tales: The Wine

Daylight horror gone wrong

When’s the last time you’ve played a horror game that takes place on a beautiful mediterranean island, surrounded by calm seas and the soothing sounds of crashing waves? Horror Tales: The Wine initially makes a compelling bid for horror: one that takes place under broad daylight and in what was supposed to be an idyllic setting—a polar opposite to the typically cramped and dank spaces of most horror fare. One sequence, for instance, had you navigate through a hedge maze—a surprisingly heart-palpitating event that had you anticipating scares around the corner.

But this momentum doesn’t always subsist, and breath-taking sights won’t just translate to genuine terror. Devoid of music and the ups and downs of an engaging narrative arc, the happenings in Horror Tales: The Wine becomes stale quickly. Coupled with some arcane puzzles that can only be resolved by loading a previous save, Horror Tales: The Wine leaves a sour taste in the mouth after a few chapters.

Unavowed

Paranormal detective work at its best

Unavowed is a Wadjet Eye game exemplified: an imaginative, macabre tale filled with twists and turns you didn’t see coming, packaged in the studio’s signature point-and-click setup. As the newest member of the Unavowed—a team of demon-busting vigilantes—you’re here to unravel the details of your lost memories, while playing detective and carrying out investigations in the nearby cities.

At the same time, Unavowed weighs in, at opportune moments, on what it means to hold on to your humanity even in unprecedented times, putting you in situations of moral dilemmas that never feel too heavy-handed. But rather than dwell on how Unavowed also cleverly entangles you with unexpected developments at almost every turn—because there’s no question that it absolutely does—the idle banter and jabs traded among its cast of paranormal detectives are heartening and authentic, moving the story forward even in its quietest moments. It’s a point-and-click game destined to be an all-time classic—which is why it is one of the entries in our best point-and-clicks list.

Induction

Incredibly clever and puzzling

Induction is deceptively clever and singularly focused on one thing: righting the often problematic mechanics of time travel. Made up of 56 puzzles that make full use of this timeless feature—in which you can fast forward or rewind time to solve its countless riddles—it’s a tough-as-nails, minimalist puzzle game about nudging a cube towards its goal. Cylinders may also be used to help you get to hard-to-reach places, but the crux of the game is about manipulating the very fabric of time so you can get to where you need to be. That said, Induction can be unforgiving in its challenges; if you’re stuck on one level, you won’t be able to move on to the next—which makes for some frustrating moments—but fortunately, a guide to solving the puzzles is readily available online.

8 Punishingly satisfying

Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: a lone nameless wanderer skulks through a blasted, foreign land to slay its twisted dominators, freeing the few survivors left, and avenging the ones who aren’t. The world is dark, filled with corrupted yet redeemable souls. Your sense of duty is born in your blood.

Fallen Flag Games isn’t the first to find FromSoftware’s genre-defining classic to be worth emulating. Eldest Souls, their brutal boss-rushing brainchild, may be the first to iterate on the formula in such a way that it really can’t be compared directly to any of its soulslike peers. It isn’t perfect, but the cycle of struggle and success feels fresh, thanks to focus on mechanical depth and creative combat customisation.

The world, though beautifully rendered, is empty of minor enemies and environmental hazards. You wander through haunting ruins, verdant forests, and frigid ice caves rather peacefully. Only the occasional key item and bits of lore await those who wish to turn over every stone. You can even meet some locals, like a bard missing a harp sting, or a priest desperate for you to join their order. The fragmented storytelling and cryptic side quests are mostly optional though, and the plot isn’t very compelling on its own—it’s largely sparse and generic—though some quests do reward you with items that boost your capabilities in combat. But without the fear of potential death around every turn—that is, you’ll just exploring the environments and solving small quests in between big boss fights in Eldest Souls—a big part of the identity of the “soulslike” genre is missing here.

Godhead

Any inch you can gain on the ten deadly rogue gods that are scattered throughout the game is appreciated. They are menaces that get more ferocious and unyielding as you progress through them, and have their own clever gimmicks, like splitting themselves into two halves, or freezing you if you get hit with multiple attacks in succession. Every boss fight needs to be studied and approached differently. This process can be extremely rewarding when you slay them, but also extremely frustrating; bosses hit so hard that they often leave very little room for error, meaning early in the process of learning, you’ll probably die several times before even seeing everything they can do in their initial phase. They also seem to have unreasonable amounts of health, especially in the later stages. I would spend so much time dodging attacks just to hit them for miniscule damage in the lull between their screen-eclipsing volleys. There’s no way to break their patterns or stun them, so you spend most of each fight waiting for your turn to attack.

The options I had when inflicting those attacks were vast. Each of the three fighting styles changes up combat dramatically, altering your normal and heavy attacks and giving you a special ability gauge to charge up. When I knew I was up against a slow but mighty enemy, the Counter style helped me turn those usually powerful blows against them. When I wanted to go all out for maximum damage potential, the Berserker Slash style helped me load big damage on single strikes. When I needed to be more evasive, the Windslide style lets me dash through enemies. Each style can be upgraded in various ways using skill points earned from bosses, which add significant alterations to these attacks. These enemies also drop Boss Shards, which you can attach to your style, specific attacks, or just to use as an active ability. Taken together, the action RPG combat possibilities in Eldest Souls really shine as some of the best you’ll find in the genre.

Souls May Cry

Fans of games like Furi and Devil May Cry may be surprised with how well Eldest Souls can produce the same sort of frantic and expressive action those games are known for. Its “soulslike” credentials don’t stem from replicating the slow and plodding experience that the subgenre is known for very much. Instead, it’s the focused and diverse boss encounters, on top of the snappy combat and clever customisation. Eldest Souls may not change the face of soulslikes just yet, but it at least demonstrates that there are still new ways to interpret them.",Eldest Souls Review

6 Solid but forgettable

Tower defence games are an odd breed. The standard version of the genre is just plonking things down, upgrading them when you can, and hoping you can get through to the next level. They’re simple, but they’re good fun. Orcs Must Die! Is a tower defence series, but it gets you a little bit more involved with the action by also throwing in some third-person shooting.

Now, I know that Orcs Must Die! 3 is the third entry in the series, but it’s not a series that many have heard of, so a little bit of information about what’s going on here is always a good thing. Every round goes like this; you get some time to lay down a variety of traps, then you let the horde of orcs know you’re ready to fight, and they charge through trying to whittle down your health.

It’s standard tower defence stuff, but it’s fun. The traps you get are the sort of gimmicks you’d expect, like tar pits and arrow launchers, but are also more fantastical things like gravity lifts. You need to place these in a way that lets them interact with each other, because it’s more effective that way, but as the game goes on, you’ll also need to cover multiple paths instead of just one, so it can be tricky to prioritise things.

Mowing down orcs

Thankfully, along with your traps, you also have yourself. You’re a powerful student capable of taking down hordes of orcs on your own anyway, and you can use a variety of weapons to do so. Each one has its pros and cons, much like the traps, and it can be quite fun to experiment with what works best for you overall, along with choosing the weapons that best fit your styles of play.

As you progress you’ll not only unlock new ways of dealing with the persistent hordes of enemies, but also be able to upgrade your favourites too. You’ll earn Skulls depending on your performance in the missions, and you can then invest these to improve both your weapons and traps, meaning you can finely craft your own way of doing things.

Sticking to the mould

The core gameplay loop here is quite good fun, and substantially more so with a friend, but I can’t help but feel as though it’s not really breaking any new ground. Everything here feels a bit guarded and familiar. Sure, there are more enemies to fight and some new modes, and those are fun, but it’s all just a bit safe.

That’s not to say it’s not a fun game, because it is, but it’s not the kind of fun that sticks in your memory and draws you back in time and time again. It’s all a bit forgettable, and maybe that’s just a case of me having my expectations set too high, but I just feel like tower defence games can do more.

That’s especially true with Orcs Must Die! 3, because the addition of shooting should add extra layers to the combat, but most of the weapons feel a bit anticlimactic to use. Again, they’re fun, but they’re never going to take your breath away or get your heart rate up. They’re all solid, but it’s not spectacular. If you’re already a fan of the series then you’ll probably enjoy this, but you’ll also find yourself uncomfortably comfortable with it all, because with Orcs Must Die! 3, not much has really changed.",Orcs Must Die! 3 Review

9 Clever And Suspenseful

Alongside video games one of my other loves is classical studies. My partner (who is a classics teacher—no joke) and I have often discussed how great it would be to have a modern Roman RPG that’s set in an authentic world with character choices and options, as players live and soak in the daily life, morality, and mentality of an Ancient Roman. Lo and behold, The Forgotten City cropped up, and we began to hype it in our house. A lot.

But did it live up to the hype? Put plainly, yes. It did. The Forgotten City is a compact marvel, a game that rewards the player with twists, mysteries and colourful characters in every direction. Really, one of my only complaints is that, as a reviewer, it is incredibly hard to say anything about it without spoiling the absolute wonder that comes with the game’s surprising twists.

After choosing a gender and name, you’ve been pulled out of a river by a helpful young lady. She tells you to go into the ruins behind you, prompting you to look for a man named Al. It’s an innocuous start to what soon becomes a time-travelling tale steeped in intrigue, betrayal, and surprisingly dark mentalities.

Full of character

On your travels through the city you will not be short of interesting folk to speak to—either idly chatting about their stories or questioning them carefully to solve the mysteries before you. With the solving of each mystery comes ten more, your journey sprawling out in front of you with every conversation. Characters have their own motives and timelines for performing actions, leaving you to intercept or allow things to take their course.

This is where the game’s key conceit comes in. The Forgotten City is housed in the ridge of a cave, trapped under rock and filled with gleaming golden figures. The citizens all abide by the ‘Golden Rule’ which states that all must suffer for the sins of the one. If one citizen sins, each and every one will be turned to gold for eternity. There is one small caveat to this… one which will see your character repeating and exploiting the same event until they get it right.

To prevent certain calamity from taking place, it has thus become your unofficial job to figure out both the secrets behind this curse and who is most likely to sin. Each character has several interactions and stories, and you must use your wits and timing to delay or prevent disaster. But The Forgotten City is not just another puzzle game with stilted and linear solutions. Instead, you can talk to anyone, go anywhere, finish or ignore quests at your discretion, with these narrative threads leading toward one of the game’s many endings.

It’s this game’s fluidity that proves to be its key strength. I was so charmed by the detail put into the characters and the narrative—their adherence to social norms of the time and the ability to philosophise with newly made friends—but even more so by my ability to make impactful choices and solve mysteries in a uniquely organic way. The Forgotten City has some of the most intelligent and complex writing I’ve seen in a game for a very long time.

Fascinatingly detailed

What was especially pleasing to video game and classics enthusiasts is the level of accuracy and detail given to the city itself and its inhabitants. Walking around, there were so many details that prompted gasps of delight: mosaics I’ve seen in person, educational details about life in Ancient Rome, board games and shops and architecture that was so informed and refreshing. So much of Ancient Roman history in pop culture is gladiators and war and fighting, that it was so much fun to explore a regular city full of average citizens, who went about their lives, working or shopping or cooking. It was tempting to just set up camp and stay for as long as possible in this gorgeously detailed world.

Once you begin to put the pieces of the mystery together it becomes even more rewarding. This is a clever story with a multi-faceted puzzle. Not only do you need to discover the genesis of the Golden Rule, but also the hidden pasts of the people around you. But even then, there is so much left to explore and discover, from charming details to deeply disturbing acts being perpetrated by residents. There is a sense of tension, a race against time, and the feeling that you almost had it… three important aspects that give The Forgotten City an impeccable sense of pacing.

Absolutely Aurelian

Although character models can be a bit repetitive and everyone looks startled all the time, the voice acting is stellar—which makes what a character is telling you so much more believable, and the sleuthing so much more immersive. Visually this is not a bad game by any means, as the painstaking details and warmth lend the game all sorts of qualities not found elsewhere. There is admittedly the occasional graphical glitch, but the discovery of each mosaic or amphora, the clothing touches and the sound of water all make it worthwhile.

Yet the blend of genres may not be for everyone. There is combat, puzzle solving, roleplay, historical education, strategy, and more—all in different amounts depending on your play style. One key feature involves repeating the same event over and over, which may result in players getting frustrated with their progress being reset, but other than that it is hard to fault.

It must be pretty obvious by now that I love this game. I love the effort that went into it and the expansive scope of its contents. I love how easy the gameplay is to grasp and how complex its plot becomes. I love the surprises and mysteries, and how each character is so full of soul. History buffs will have hours of spotting little details and accuracies, and fans of a good old-fashioned mystery will be kept up all night by the perplexing curse that has befallen this town.",The Forgotten City Review

7 Mindless cyberpunk fun

One of the most captivating sights in The Ascent is the labyrinthine layout of its cyberpunk city. From a distance, its underbelly—one place you’ll spend a lot of time in—looks like densely packed circuit boards, with buildings and other structures housed together across several districts, until they all meld together into one congested urban hive. Then there’s the non-stop chattering of its ill-fated denizens and squatters, as they bemoan and grumble about their misfortunes amidst a backdrop of an ultra futuristic cityscape.

All these are, admittedly, par for the course for most cyberpunk cities, and The Ascent really doesn’t stray from this formula much. What underlies the sordid appeal of cyberpunk, despite its ubiquity in games and pop culture, is still in watching the disparity between a powerless populace and its squalid city, versus the undercurrent of clandestine, corporate power that courses through it. It’s almost like a modern parable, a chilling prophecy of our very near future.

But as a brutal top-down action shooter, The Ascent excels at capturing the excessive violence of surviving in this cyberpunk hellhole. This is a place overrun by crime lords and their petty squabbles, as they struggle to get a foothold over the politics of this less-than-flourishing city. It’s poignantly reminiscent of one of the genre’s biggest inspirations: the turbulent social dynamics of living in Hong Kong’s Kowloon Walled City in the early 70s, and it shows in every interaction in the game. Every moment in The Ascent is punctuated by violence and firefights, every other encounter beginning with a faceless henchman of a rival gang pointing their guns at you, demanding your subservience or snarling at you to step away from an off-limits area. Then you’ll whip out your guns, engaging in rapid spasms of gunfire and violence for a few brief minutes, while passers-by frantically scramble away from the senseless crossfire.

This is a loop that takes place over and over again: you just have to keep shooting at waves of everything before they can kill you. Even innocents get killed too—an unfortunate collateral damage in all these mindless bloodshed—as they make a haphazard escape towards safety, sometimes inevitably running into your line of fire. From The Ascent’s top-down perspective, it’s hard to tell the difference between a panicked face and a gang member taking a few cautious steps backwards so that they can take better aim at your head. And that feels like a deliberate decision: you’re not supposed to care that much about who’s getting hurt.

Going on a loop

This isn’t necessarily an awful thing; I do admire the lack of pretension from The Ascent. Unlike other cyberpunk games that gorge their narrative with a glut of moralising that quickly deflates under scrutiny, The Ascent is unpretentious about its motives: it’s tightly focused on the joy of clicking and shooting shit up. To an extent, it’s a lot like the point-and-click mania of Diablo, but set in a generic but grandiose cyberpunk city.

Here’s the gist of it: you begin, quite literally, at the bowels of the city, clearing out manure for a small-time mob boss who’s just yelling at you incessantly over the intercom. He talks a lot about being neck-deep in piss and spews a whole load of bile, but wants you to sort out some problems by shooting at things, and flipping a few switches. You’re given a gun, and then you shoot at some vicious, underground ferals that are only too eager to gnaw off a chunk of you. Then you rinse and repeat, until you shoot all the evil beings. You eventually display a knack for shooting, and your crime lord boss instructs you to meet him, so you can carry out more gunning. Of course, there’s actually a whole lot of context in between all these encounters, but it really doesn’t matter; while the city itself can be enthralling in its intricacies, everyone else living in here is too one-dimensional for any sort of nuance.

The joys of shooting

For the bulk of The Ascent, the shooting is frantic and punchy. Dispatching the countless goons, ferals and other high-tech machinery standing in your way is a matter of aiming your sights towards them and unleashing a hailstorm of bullets in their direction. In lieu of narrative depth, there’s a surprising amount of versatility in combat; you can crouch behind obstacles and walls, or even pull off a nifty maneuver, in which you’ll raise your gun slightly to shoot over obstacles, deal a bit more damage, and stagger your opponents. There are also additional attacks you can perform by installing cyber augmentations in your noggins, some of which will let you pulverise your foes with a hydraulic powered punch, or summon a battle droid to snipe at enemies alongside you. Then there’s also the usual trappings of most RPGs: killing more levels your character up, resulting in skill points you can assign to your character, which essentially makes you better at killing. You can upgrade your firearms and rocket canons with components—an uncomplicated currency you can trade in with gunsmiths in the city to improve your weapon’s lethality.

And, as the game progresses, you’ll find that there are more of the same to do. You’ll collect an inordinate amount of loot from crates and chests littered everywhere in this universe. You’ll pick up bounties on unique variants of the same enemies you usually encounter, who will drop better loot and more cash. You’re obliterating an entire city’s worth of scumbags under the direction of your mob boss. There’s a very specific set of routines you’ll find yourself getting hooked onto: shoot baddies, find equipment, hoard loot, sell stuff. Getting into the rhythm of The Ascent never gets too complicated, even if combat itself can be brutalising and challenging at times.

Mindlessly violent

These all goes to say that The Ascent is mostly a mindless, violent jaunt through a meticulously rendered cyberpunk city; what little portrayal of the themes of depravity and inequality are merely set-dressing for the game. Yet for all its facelessness, what was most indelible was still its city, the disparity between the powerful and powerless depicted in its spaces: from the cramped, unsanitary alleys home to the ceaseless chatter of its most downtrodden, to the shine of the marble floor in the wealthier districts, soon to be sullied by the dead bodies you leave behind.

However, all these are merely incidental to the game’s main conceit: to turn you into an efficient killing machine amidst the metallic skyscrapers of its city, morality be damned. Just like the trite aura of exoticism in its neon billboards and signages—you get zero context behind the prominence of the Asian characters and smiling geishas—The Ascent is content with using cyberpunk as another playground for its violence, rather than to present an alternative vision of the genre. Which is fair, and still makes it very enjoyable. I, too, can always use another few hours reducing meatbags into blood and guts.",The Ascent Review

6.5 Fun but not exceptional

The protagonist of Out of Line is apparently named San. This is information, however, that I never came across when playing the actual game. There is no dialogue at all; Out of Line prefers to approach its slim storytelling in a subtler fashion. As San, a little, odd looking character, you wield a golden, needle-like spear that you can aim and hurl at walls to get to higher places. You must evade robot enemies, collect mysterious blue items that help restore trees, and assist others as you go, some of whom look exactly like you. Are they really just alternate versions of you? Why do these blue objects restore nature? I can’t tell, which leads me to a significant issue…

Nothing, outside of gameplay actions, is explained. The game takes the classic ‘show, don’t tell’ style and goes perhaps a little too far with it, unfortunately. Some things can be gleaned without any context—clearly San and their allies are escaping from an area where robots wish to keep them imprisoned or perhaps even kill them. Why? It’s unclear, but the official description of the game mentions that this area is a ‘factory’, and so I’m assuming San and co are used as workers or resources for these robots.

One theme that comes through clearly is a sense of camaraderie, of working together. There are various moments where you must rely on the assistance of your allies to progress, like large, ungainly figures that help you up to high areas and defeat your enemies for you when you get near enough to them, or tiny allies that crucially assist you in puzzles by operating mechanisms so you can progress; you can lead the latter around at points and direct them to specific mechanisms purely through your movement, operating these mechanisms in a certain order that allows you to proceed. There are even moments where the game will pause just so your character can give a little wave to another ally before moving on. You help others to proceed, and in return they help you—there is some teamwork at play, even though you never really communicate much with one another. They offer no verbal reason for helping you, nor do you give any to them, and in light of visible danger, more exposition isn’t needed anyway, as you aid one another in fleeing from the intimidating machines and avoiding capture and harm. The danger these machines pose is clear; they are truly menacing, their jarring noises and relentless swooping down to grab you or smash things reminiscent of the robots in The Matrix.



Puzzle-focused

There are various puzzles that force you to play around with moving platforms and oddly expiring sticks to progress. For one, you’ll have to work out which levers to pull in a specific order so that you can pass damaging steam bursts and operate platforms, or predict when to throw your spear into a gear and jam it from moving. The difficulty and platforming on the whole is well-balanced. While stuck at points, I never got to the point where I was fuming or tempted to give up—I usually solved the puzzles after a handful of attempts.

Then there’s the graceful feeling of throwing your spear, leaping atop it, hopping as if on a spring to reach a higher area, and then—just before landing—summoning the spear back to you with a tap of the button, catching it while you continue to run. It’s the one part where things really just click, and it feels as if you’re Steve Rogers grabbing his shield as it shoots back to his hand. The spear also works well later in the game, where you attach a rope to it and then hurl it across to another platform, creating a bridge for you to travel across. But this enjoyable rope feature is sadly underutilised.

A little shallow

The game looks pretty at times, its painted environments of forest-like areas and lovely ancient stone settings a stark contrast to the grim-looking factory at the beginning. Performance issues are minimal; playing on the Nintendo Switch, there was just some slight judder here and there, as well as something—probably a small part of a puzzle which didn’t allow me to pass—failing to trigger during my second playthrough.

However, there’s nothing in Out of Line that excites me, or makes me sit up and take notice. ‘Showing’ can be a wonderful approach for story-telling, but it’s also a tricky one to pull off in terms of making the setting and characters memorable. I don’t think this game managed that effectively, even though it plays well—and is fun—as a game. The closest thing to grabbing my attention would be the spear device, using it to jump up higher or attach to other platforms with a rope, something I’ve not encountered much before in other games. All in all, Out of Line isn’t a terrible experience; I only wished there was a stronger emphasis on establishing its odd setting, along with something more that I could point to as being exceptional.",Out of Line Review

4 Bland and frustrating

This is a review of 5 hours of what I believe is the game’s Early Access content. I have not played more, and am unlikely to do so as it would be a disservice to both myself and the game.

The short of it is that this game is aggressively boring.

As an outside consumer, the name The Protagonist: EX-1 calls to mind something generic, like a bargain bin film for $5, likely starring Bruce Willis, that you somehow have not seen or heard of before but that still exists. This is accurate advertising.

Nothing fresh

In The Protagonist: EX-1, your character (a hot white woman named Angel) wakes with mild amnesia, a voice in her head (Pilot) guiding her throughout the blue science-fiction base. Angel is a martial arts expert, a quick shot with a gun and can hack things with implants in her brain. Her “training” is regularly alluded to. She slowly accumulates a squad of players, from the tough guy Radical, to more generic infantry-like characters with names like Raven, etc as she explores this base, picking up audio-logs and fighting floating robots.

A turn-based strategy game with squad building and door puzzles, the most novel element of The Protagonist: EX-1 is perhaps that one of your squad-mates can be a dog that acts as a healer. Even that cannot save this game from being a soup of bland sameness. The key to RNG-based combat is that it somehow must walk the razor’s edge of freshness and fairness. Freshness is that each new combat encounter must feel in some way unique. It’s one of the reasons a designer uses randomness, rather than carefully scripting encounters. Fairness is a bit more complicated. The game doesn’t have to actually be fair, it just has to feel fair–the player shouldn’t go into an encounter, die slowly and painfully over the course of several incredibly dry turns, then restart the level and change nothing about their strategy and win in four turns. That feels like malfunctioning RNG, the bane of every angry loser on the Internet. The Protagonist: EX-1 feels deeply unfair, to the point of frustration.

Time wasters

A game that has a poor mechanical base can be saved by any number of things, but that is not the case here. The graphics are polished for an independent game–think early Mass Effect–but the environments are incredibly similar, to the point where there is basically nothing novel to be found here. The door puzzles, which are frequently just “find the pillar that looks like a salt lamp and go through a two step sequence to unlock a door across the screen,” feel like time wasters. Having your characters narratively call out that these annoyances exist, or to be like “why are things like this” is not meta, it’s just lampshading bad design.

Ultimately The Protagonist: EX-1 is another addition to the turn-based strategy game that requires no strategy, with a squad that provides no interest. I cannot begin to care enough about this game to continue playing it, and cannot find a reason to recommend it.",The Protagonist: EX-1 Review

8 Addictive and frantic

Boomerang X, the first commercial release from New York-based developer DANG!, is a frantic-as-hell experience. Armed with just a boomerang and some handy unlockable powers, you must eliminate a monstrous threat lurking beneath the world, one seeking to corrupt and consume everything and everyone in its wake. It’s up to you to stop this leviathan-sized creature. Hurling your boomerang—and by extension, yourself—across 13 levels, you glide through the enclosed battle arenas like some airborne assassin, whilst defeating waves of grotesque ghouls all vying to desecrate your mummified body.

Boomerang X has the trappings of a great FPS despite some performance issues hindering the game on Nintendo Switch. It even rivals the frenetic kineticism of developer id Software’s Doom, and the games inspired by Doomguy’s escapes like Project Warlock, Strafe, and Wrath: Aeon of Ruin.

You play as… a mummy, or something? It doesn’t really matter. Boomerang X’s narrative is delivered through environmental storytelling, like statues depicting quad-peddled insects called Yoran, and crystalised instruments. There’s also the friendly centipede Tepan occasionally hanging around the game world, imparting brief insights about where those monsters might originate from and how its village was destroyed. Otherwise, the plot is irrelevant, with hints of dark forces emanating from the leviathan-like monstrosity biding its time deep inside the world. In a game like Boomerang X, the focus is more on the sweat-inducing combat than whatever nonsensical narrative it tries to tell.

Paper-thin tale

Still, ignoring the story in a world as intriguing as Boomerang X’s is a bummer. There’s some real mystery behind the characters and setting—and particularly that mantid weapon you use. Who is the Yoran? What the hell is that leviathan-esque creature? How do we even end up on this random-ass island in the first place? None of these questions are answered and by the game’s end, many more remain. It’s fine if a game puts tight first-person shooter elements above its narrative, but there isn’t much to chew on in Boomerang X’s paltry story in the first place.

Thankfully, combat makes up for the inconsequential plot. Like Doom, Boomerang X is a momentum-based FPS. The key to survival is continuous movement; sit still for too long and you’re for sure dead. But unlike Doom, it’s much simpler and way more creative. With the Slingshot ability alone—which is unlocked early on and lets you pull yourself toward the boomerang no matter where it’s thrown—the momentum is fluid as you soar through the air, flipping around and sniping enemies (often in slow-mo with the Flux power) before jetting to the next spot. It’s an addictive loop riffing on teleportation, which is made all the more engaging when the three other abilities (plus one ultimate) are unlocked.

And it’s here where you express yourself as an airborne assassin. Do you use the piercing ability Needle to take out multiple monsters in a row, or do you swap to the shotgun-like Scattershot to hit the creatures closing in on you, all whilst avoiding projectiles and the occasional screen-filling boss? It’s a tense cognitive and mechanical dance to outsmart both yourself (to preserve powers) and the enemies.

Soar through the wind

But when things get tense, and they will since everything wants you dead, Boomerang X tends to chug if not outright skip a few frames, especially on the Switch. You could be flying through the air one moment, using Flux to line up the perfect shot, only to then find yourself facing a different direction the next. It’s jarring and disrupts the momentum the game hinges on. There’s also so much happening that keeping your head on straight, whilst following the chaos, can be disorienting. This often leads to some frustrating deaths. However, they can be mitigated through a solid suite of accessibility and gameplay options, like increased visibility and an invincibility mode. As someone with impaired vision, having options to adjust the gameplay experience in such a challenging (and hella fun) shooter is a boon.

Boomerang X may not be perfect, but it’s perfectly addictive, a game just begging to be replayed. There’s even a built-in speed run timer setting and harder difficulty options and a New Game+ mode underscoring its replayability. Running through its 13 levels another time probably won’t peel back any more of the game’s very thin plot layers, but damn if it isn’t a blast to zip around like an airborne assassin.",Boomerang X Review

4 promising but confounding

Outsider: After Life begins with a skull toppling off a skeleton to complete the circuit needed for android HUD-ini to start repairing themselves. Humanity is dying, and so HUD-ini is tasked with fixing yourself and the universe in turn, primarily through the medium of puzzles. It’s not a small ask, but the first step is always the biggest. For Outsider: After Life, it’s also this first step that was handled the best.

To begin, you need to repair HUD-ini’s camera, fusion battery, and CPU (or their eyes, heart and brain). Each puzzle is unique, so working out what the puzzle is is half of solving it. For instance, to calibrate HUD-ini’s CPU, I started off connecting scrambled shapes to the correct nubbins on a wheel in the back of their head. Connecting all the nubbins turned the wheel to reveal something that looked closer to a brain, where I rotated torches to reveal the shapes I needed to match in their… brain nodes? That then segued into a timing-based puzzle, where I had to adjust little butterfly clips to ensure the synapses that fired between those nodes all landed simultaneously.

There’s a lot of “oh god what words do I use here”, because the puzzles are just visual; the default instructions are only a suggestion of a mouse gesture. They weren’t particularly tricky to start with; it was simply satisfying to work out what I needed to do and how–similar to unfolding one of those wooden puzzle boxes. Even the transitions between tasks had an internal logic; there was something mechanical to fix, or an obstacle in my way. It was a strong introduction to the game and its systems, but once HUD-ini was repaired and ready to leave the laboratory, the quality started to drop off.

Where it finally begins

After finishing this opening area, you see a story moment of a (human!) cleaner being reprimanded by an off-screen voice. These vignettes continue to pop up between chunks of puzzles (or sometimes in the middle of them), but they’re disjointed and inconsistent, only suggesting a larger whole that isn’t actually there once you try to piece it together. I dislike separating ‘gameplay’ and ‘story’ like this–it’s all story as far as I’m concerned–but Outsider: After Life does separate it, to the extent that its overt story seems to contradict the more subtle narrative of the rest of the game.

HUD-ini pursues a goal of resetting the universe. They do this even to destructive ends, overwriting the stored history of humankind at one point during a puzzle. It’s what every puzzle you do is leading you towards, but in the end this goal is handwaved, and the more sinister implications of HUD-ini’s journey ignored. This disconnect between the game experienced and the story told makes the ending–which is otherwise a spectacle–feel sudden, strange and unearned.

Feeling numb

The puzzles themselves also diminish in quality after leaving the laboratory. While some retain that unique puzzle box approach to solving discrete problems from the opening section, the further you progress through the game, the more certain puzzles overstay their welcome. Rather than solving a particular problem and moving on, they just iterate on a specific mechanic for several levels–less puzzle box, and more like one very long game of jenga. I learnt the logic, I applied it, and then I was… still going on at it.

This felt particularly abrasive because some longer puzzles had significant migraine triggers. One asked that I recreate the patterns of constellations from a constantly spinning sky. Another replicated a CRT-style screen with obvious, repetitive flickering. A third flashed the screen bright red every time you completed one of its many stages. During these sections I had to take screen breaks every few minutes, which is an experience I’ve only had with one other game.

Outsider: After Life shows in its opening section that it knows what it’s doing. The process of repairing HUD-ini is finely tuned, and sets up intrigue for what comes next. It’s a shame that it only gives way to increasingly repetitive, sometimes painful gameplay, and mismatched pieces of story that don’t quite fit into the full picture.",Outsider: After Life Review

4 Subversive but tedious

Top-down shooters have always held a certain appeal. There’s something cathartic about engaging in a spot of mindless destruction by mowing down a seemingly endless supply of enemies. It’s a fine genre, but one that rarely offers anything drastically new. So when an intriguing idea peers out from the pile, I always feel inclined to give it a try.

Radio Viscera is one such game. It’s a twin-stick shooter where your weapon is incapable of firing bullets, which initially sounds like an antithesis of the genre. Instead, you’ll ragdoll your foes across the game’s various stages using a powerful air cannon. Though it may sound kind of cutesy, it’s still pretty violent, considering you will dispatch enemies by knocking them into the numerous hazards that litter the levels, including comically large saw blades, flamethrowers and spike traps.

It makes a promising first impression. You play as a humanoid creature trying to escape a Satanic Y2K cultist compound, a quirky setting that provides the odd titter, although this narrative is mostly—and sadly—relegated to background noise. The focus is purely on shooting folks, and once you’ve acquired the air gun, you will immediately begin punting enemies into vats of acid and blasting holes in walls to progress. Doors are arbitrary in a world where you can eliminate the very foundations of a building, you see.

Hazards galore

At first it’s exhilarating to line up your shots, such that your enemies will flail helplessly across the screen to their impending doom, exploding into chunks of blood upon landing in a saw blade. It’s not overly gory, thanks to Radio Viscera’s affable aesthetic but feels brutal nonetheless. Unlike our hero, the standard foes carry guns with bullets, but a quick air cannon shot to the sternum knocks their weapon out of their hands. From there, you can go camp beside it and wait to blow them away as they frantically dart across the room in a miserable bid to retrieve their gun.

Your accuracy doesn’t have to be spot on either, which certainly works in the game’s favour. Each hazard seems to possess its own gravitational pull, so it’s a case of close enough is good enough, which helps maintain the frantic momentum that makes twin-stick shooters a joy. However, whilst the opening levels are great fun, the further you progress, the more cracks appear in Radio Viscera’s foundations, some of which stem from the concept itself.

The game struggles immensely with implementing variety to proceedings, though it desperately wants to provide some. This can be seen in how later levels introduce additional enemy types designed to force you to alter your tactics, but instead, only serve to stall the flow of the game. There are these heavily armed foes that roll up into a ball like a pill bug whenever you shoot at them. Not only does this limit how far you can knock them back, but their stubborn shells also grant them immunity from some hazards. This results in fairly tedious segments where you gradually push them towards something powerful enough to penetrate their armour.

Lacking ideas

Since the original premise is so one-dimensional, the developers could only sprinkle in variety using different enemy types. But the more variants it includes, the further Radio Viscera moves away from the simple satisfaction that makes the early stages a delight. Sure, additional hazards also appear, but ultimately they’re just another giant saw blade with an alternative presentation. The penultimate level has some success with a segment that feels pinball-esque in its execution, but at that point, most people will have moved on.

The attempts at mixing things up might not feel so unsuccessful if everything wasn’t marred further by several technical issues. The camera is, frankly, nauseating. Even with camera shake switched off in the options menu, it would still swing around wildly at times, making anyone with motion sickness feel woozy. On top of that, I fell off the map and died on multiple occasions, which, considering your score gets reset to zero upon death, was a tad irritating.

There is a reasonable game lurking somewhere inside Radio Viscera. The early knockings were enough to show me that there is a lot of fun to be had with this concept. However, the attempts at including variety often miss the mark, and a string of technical problems exacerbate the game’s shortcomings. It is certainly a novel attempt to subvert the genre, but, ultimately, it falls incredibly short. Instead, it makes me yearn for a more traditional twin-stick shooter, even if that would offer no surprises.",Radio Viscera Review

7 Challenging and thought-provoking

Numbers can be maddening. Our own Milky Way galaxy is estimated to contain between 100 and 400 billion stars, and we now know that many of those stars have planetary systems (and that “many” may even be “most” or “nearly all”). If the average star is circled by somewhere between one planet and our own solar system’s nine, that would mean that the number of planets in the galaxy could be anywhere from 100 billion to 3.6 trillion.

And the universe is estimated to contain as many as two trillion galaxies.

Given these numbers, it seems ludicrous to believe that we could be the only planet capable of looking up and wondering if there’s anyone else out there.

And yet, we have yet to confirm the existence of life anywhere else in the universe. There are tantalising hints that Mars and Venus may have been habitable in the past. The moons Europa and Enceladus show signs of liquid water beneath their ice crusts, which might harbour life based on geothermal energy.

But still, so far nothing. Earth is the only body in the universe on which life is known to have arisen. And until the confirmation of any sort of life anywhere other than here, the fact remains that we may indeed be alone.

Impossibly big

This incongruity between the literally unimaginable number of possible places for life to exist and our apparent solitude has been described as the Fermi Paradox (so called as a result of a lunchtime conversation about the possibility of extraterrestrial life at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1950 that ended with the physicist Enrico Fermi saying something to the effect of “But where is everybody?”), and this paradox provides both the inspiration for–and the title of–a new game from Anomaly Games, currently in Early Access on Steam.

As a game, The Fermi Paradox is a civilisation simulator that tasks the player with nudging along (or hindering) the development of intelligent life on a number of planets in a corner of the Milky Way with a stated goal of bringing these civilisations into contact across the stars. This is, rightly, a challenging prospect, as while the development of life on various planets is treated as a fairly commonplace event, the emergence of intelligent life is much less frequent; at any point in its development a civilisation may be eradicated by war, famine, or the consequences of its own technology. There’s no guarantee that any particular civilisation will ever develop the capacity to send or detect electromagnetic signals capable of reaching across the stars, much less physical travel to other systems.

A boundless galaxy

The difficult part of trying to assess a civilisation simulator like The Fermi Paradox is that there’s so, so much work put into it that any individual player might never see. If I was frustrated by the way the game seemed limited to common wisdom assumptions about the linear nature of technological progress (Bronze Age precedes Iron Age precedes the age of nautical exploration precedes…), I was delighted by the art and text that would shift to reflect the details of the game’s fictional cultures.

My most successful species was a group of intelligent dolphins that went on to colonise three other systems (one of which had been previously inhabited, but was no longer by the time the dolphins arrived). The first group to leave the Sol system were outcasts who wore cyberpunk visors. The group left behind developed a symbiotic relationship with artificial intelligence and started referring to themselves as “digital siblings.” Later they barely survived a nuclear war and became “digital remnant fragments” (meanwhile, the outcasts started calling themselves “neo-dolphins,” and eventually came to live under the tyranny of a sentient space canon). While I think a great deal of the terminology would be similar, I’d love to see the artwork that would open up had I chosen dinosaurs as the dominant species instead.

But then I have to come back to the numbers again (after all, for all the delight of the narrative moments and visual art, every simulator is essentially a math engine under the hood). I can wish that the game operated in a bit less of a zero-sum fashion between societies, especially those connected by nothing more than the player’s attention. Story and development events have divergent outcomes depending, in part, on simple player choice, but influenced even more through the expenditure of points that the player accrues slowly over time, or more quickly by opting for negative outcomes.

Thus the successful progress of any one society is aided by the suffering of any other. If my dolphins discovered uninhabited worlds in the course of their exploration it was, at least in one case, because some time ago I had allowed one planet’s population to exterminate itself in order to hoard enough points, allowing the dolphins to survive the disasters they would inevitably encounter.

Where is everybody?

There’s a comment there on the reality of “unpopulated spaces” here on earth that may or may not have anything to do with Fermi. Space may be empty, but our planet is anything but, and the “empty” spaces we have colonised have frequently been built at the expense of the very real people who were there last year, or yesterday, or are still there today.

In the stars, “Where is everybody?” is a question that may have no answer. Here on earth, it is a question we simply would prefer not to answer.",The Fermi Paradox (Early Access) Review

6 Fun but arduous

Black Skylands is a game that promises a vast open-world filled with beauty to explore, the chance to fight against sky pirates and horrifying monsters both on foot and while in a flying ship, and an introduction to what skypunk is.

You play as Eva, a daughter of the Earners, and someone who has spent a lot of their life aboard the fathership, which is basically just a big old flying ship in the sky. You see, the world’s not like the one you and I know. Instead, there are floating islands all over the world of Aspya, so you’d better not have a fear of heights.

Naturally, while things all start off very peaceful, everything goes horribly wrong after the tutorial, and you suddenly find yourself having to fight for survival against not just a horrifying group of monsters called The Swarm, but also a bunch of sky pirates. These aren’t like the ones in Skies of Arcadia, so try to put them out of your mind. Anyway, that’s the setting, but how does it all feel to play?

Is that a bush or a head?

Black Skylands is played from a top-down perspective, which means a lot of the characters you interact with will just look like hair and shoulders most of the time, at least when you’re not chatting to them and seeing the rather beautifully pixelated portraits. The pixel art style is stunning, but when combined with the top-down perspective, it can actually make a few sections of the game rather frustrating to traverse.

I found myself getting stuck on bits of wood that weren’t obviously barriers here and there, and when you’re in the middle of a gunfight, or just in a bit of a rush, that’s really not what you want.

Combat is mostly ranged, but is split between being on foot or in the sky on your ship. On foot, combat is basically just a twin-stick shooter, but you can melee enemies as well. You’ll find your ammo reserves running low if you only rely on ranged, so you’re encouraged to kill enemies off using melee attacks because it makes them drop ammunition.

Yarrr, but in the sky

Ship combat is a little more convoluted. Your weapons are mounted on the side of your vessel, and you’ll need to adjust the angle of them as you go, along with making sure you actually fire the correct side to land a hit. It’s fun, but can feel a little finicky in some faster-paced battles.

Outside of that, most of the game has you crafting and managing your colony. You’ll need to grow food, gather resources, clear debris, repair things, and even liberate islands as you journey around Aspya. This side of things is good in theory, but the actual time required to gather a lot of the materials can make the process feel rather arduous.

Of course, it’s all still in Early Access, for now, so this all might change over the next year or so, but as it stands, if you’re coming in here hoping for something with a spring in its step, you’ll be disappointed. Black Skylands demands you play it at the pace it’s set at, and that’s going to put some players off despite the setting of Aspya being fairly intriguing.",Black Skylands (Early Access) Review

8.5 Intriguingly pessismistic

Capitalism is based on systems of exploitation. These take several different forms, but alienated labour is, by far, the most important part of this process. The idea is this: you can get more money from the sale of a commodity than you actually deserve, in terms of your contribution to its production, by claiming it as your personal property. You’re taking what belonged to someone else, who contributed more to the very process of production.

Bear with me for a bit, but let’s say you’re a small business owner who spends an hour daily on the shop floor apart from weekends, while I work 50 hours a week making boots. We make 100 boots a month, which nets us $10,000 at $100 each. You pay me $2,000 and pocket the remaining $8,000, since you purchased the materials needed for the boots. Yet I worked on these for 200 hours, while you only spent 20 hours. The result is that I get ripped off and you get substantially more. As such I’m alienated from my labour, and you get a pile of unearned income.

You might call this a grift.

The developer behind Griftlands, Klei Entertainment, takes capitalism to its logical conclusion by imagining a world in which no alternative to exploitation exists. In short, you have to get them before they get you.

The concept of alienated labor is, in many ways, the key to understanding the story in Griftlands. Everybody is either swindling or being swindled–sometimes both at the same time. There are three playable characters: Sal, Rook and Smith. Sal is a bounty hunter trying to get revenge on the person who sold them into indentured servitude as a child, while Rook is a war veteran hired to prevent workers from rising up in revolution against a robber baron. Then there’s Smith, a black sheep who gets cut out of their inheritance by their siblings after the death of their wealthy parents. You can shape the story through some of your decisions, but the overall theme is the same no matter which path you choose to take.

Exploit or be exploited

Exploitation is in everything in Griftlands. This takes place at multiple levels: while you’ve got the questionable actions of Sal, Rook and Smith on the one hand, you’ve got the various predations of church and state on the other. There’s thievery and corruption; There’s tithes and taxes. Even though the trio has similar plot arcs, the writing is wonderful on the whole, yet I couldn’t help wanting to know more about the world and how it works. Places. People. Factions. It’s a game that would benefit from a little bit more context.

Griftland’s in-depth structure and progression system reward multiple runs. This consists of a deck-building mechanic which breaks down into combat and negotiation, fitting right into the overall theme of exploitation. Combat is of course a zero-sum game by its very nature, in that there necessarily has to be a winner and a loser. Negotiation in a world like the one in Griftlands amounts to combat by another name: swindle or be swindled. When you think about it like this, it makes a lot of sense to apply the same gameplay for both combat and negotiation, but I can’t help feeling that a more distinctive type of deck-building mechanic might work better for negotiation. Something about it just doesn’t quite feel like a war of words.

In spite of this, I really like how the deck-building mechanics reflect the dispositions of the different characters. You can see this in both combat and negotiation; Sal is pretty strong all around, which makes them a good choice for your first couple of runs. Rook flips a coin every now and then during negotiation that can produce a powerful boost. Smith builds up a stockpile of empty bottles while in combat which they sometimes hurl at their opponents. The result is a wonderful sense of ludonarrative consonance.

The artwork in Griftlands can only be described as gorgeous, even if some animations are stiff and others are used too many times, but the most important point is that it picks up on the overall theme of exploitation. The wealthy live in the lap of luxury in massive mansions and the poor make do with privation in shabby shacks. While the religious and secular authorities can be found in billowing robes and crisp uniforms, the unwashed masses are clothed in overalls and combat gear.

The characters are also effusively expressive. Sal has a slightly menacing look and Rook has the big smile of a con man. Smith is clearly supposed to be care free. The music is perfectly suited to the grim setting. The maps are what I like most of all, but they also convey the harsh realities of life in these kinds of locations, with the game taking you to a colony and a company town before sending you off to a trading hub. The colony is a gleaming tower and a cluster of cabins. The company town is a stylish office surrounded by slums. The trading hub is a ghetto apart from the gated community at its centre. The inequalities come through loud and clear.

The nature of capitalism

Klei Entertainment made a world which is all about exploitation. The commentary on capitalism in Griftlands couldn’t be any more conspicuous. However, the developer seems to have fallen into the trap of assuming that capitalism is natural instead of artificial, as the game doesn’t present you with any alternatives. The result is a pretty dismal state of affairs.

The fact of the matter is that capitalism is a social construct. The systems of exploitation which make it function were produced by people over the course of several centuries. This point is particularly salient because it points to our capacity to shape the course of events. We have complete control over the future. We haven’t reached the end of history. Capitalism wasn’t some kind of inevitability, and it doesn’t have to go on forever.

This, in my opinion, is the only thing which Griftlands really gets wrong; it seems to suggest we’re stuck with a broken system which can only get more broken with time. You come away feeling as though our society is fundamentally flawed. This just isn’t true, though. Capitalism is an artificial construct. We made it, and we can unmake it. There will be a day when capitalism sits in the dustbin of history; I hope that more developers come to this conclusion, eventually.",The Indie Game Website

Mighty Goose

Plenty to honk about

The sleek, retro veneer of Mighty Goose and its recontexualing of Contra-style shooters as a barnyard of animal supersoldiers mostly demonstrate one thing: it is, at its heart, a loving homage and a side-scroller shooter moulded in the punishing run-and-gun arcade games of yesteryears.

As a monosyllabic goose who prefers to let your guns–be it machine guns or rocket launchers–do the talking, you’ll be traversing across planets, dodging gunfire and bulldozing legions of robots and bugs with a flurry of bullets sprayed all over the screen. There’s no poetic justice to be meted out, no truly dastardly plot to raze the universe to the ground, and no tearjerker or heroic moments: just the opportunity to enact scenes of pure, exhilarating carnage.

Garbage

I don’t really know what’s going on

On the surface, Garbage is a homeless fighting simulator that carries parallels to Punch Club: train hard, win fights, and take showers–the only twist being that you’re a homeless man who now has to live next to the dumpster. But take a closer look beyond its hood, and you’ll find that Garbage is a game that is barely serviceable.

After being thrown into a tutorial with remarkably vague instructions, you’ll spend a couple of befuddling minutes wondering what’s going on, before being told that you’ll be encountering a “garbage invasion”. It’s a declaration that makes so little sense until you realise it’s just a fisticuffs session with another homeless guy, who will be absent-mindedly wandering into your less-than-humble abode for a fight. The idea, in subsequent hours, is that you’ll soon be leading a team of homeless folks that will eventually lead to a bigger uprising against the tyranny of the local police force. I’m not too sure actually, and it’s probably impossible to know at this rate, since I couldn’t spend more than half an hour on this title.

RAZE 2070

Shoots like raindrops

Even among the most unimaginative of blockbuster games and first-person shooters, it’s usually their elaborate, even needlessly sophisticated gunplay that stands out, as well as the ridiculous variety of ways you can snipe the tiny heads off your enemies. You can probably modify your firearms with countless upgrades, cobble together your own rifles from spare parts, and even admire the intricate wood grains of a pistol’s grip if it so pleases you. For many of these games, the shooting and sniping and blasting of your fleshy foes is the point; story, morality and anything else be damned.

Which is why it’s so perplexing that RAZE 2070, an arena shooter in the vein of popular fare like Doom and Unreal Tournament, makes shooting feel so limp. Rather than a full-bodied explosion, every gunshot is instead akin to the gentle patter of raindrops on concrete pavements–an almost maudlin description that’s probably the furthest thing RAZE 2070 wants to be known for. Much less can be said about its android enemies, which more closely resemble crash test dummies than the high tech cyborgs of sci-fi shooters. Then there is its introduction video–a snapshot into RAZE 2070’s intergalactic setting–which is made up of mostly stock footage of space from sites like Getty Images. Probably.

Until We Die

A sombre base defense game

Until We Die is exactly what it says on the box: you have to defend your base until you’re deceased. Stuck in an underground station with only a few workers, you’ll need to gather resources like gears and food, while fortifying your base with barricades and other necessities, such as equipment like shovels and spanners that lets your workers carry out their tasks more efficiently. Every few hours or so, mutants will try to overwhelm your base, and one day they’ll most probably succeed.

There’s a fatalistic element to this setup, a sense that whatever fortifications you’ve put up is only temporary and can only stem the tide of attacks for only so long. Your workers are also not soldiers; they’re merely workers looking for a space to bunk over, and can mostly only prod at the beasts to fend them away. It’s a base defense strategy game that dabbles in realism rather than pointless commotion, and it’s a very captivating one. There are minor issues, such as the need for more precise controls (you can’t choose which worker you wish to station at every barricade), but aside from a few frustrating moments, these mostly don’t detract from its strengths.

Promesa

Not very alive

There’s plenty to scrutinise about virtual spaces, and the unspoken tales of the people and past events that inhabit them, whether these are cluttered with artefacts or bereft of any human life or presence. Take for instance an eerily empty kitchen with a still-whistling kettle, as well as utensils neatly laid out on the dining table–a place that may seem macabre and out-of-sorts within an otherwise ordinary home.

In this sense, Promesa attempts to convey a moving, intergenerational tale through its spaces, as it shuttles the player to various locales, interspersing these journeys with quotes shared by a grandfather to his grandchild. You don’t really need to do much; you just walk until you can’t anymore, and then you’ll be transported to the next place. But these spaces are also mostly devoid of meaningful context; I wasn’t even aware I was reading a familial conversation until I read the synopsis on a website. Then there are the purportedly haunting and surreal spaces, which are as sparse and lifeless as the memories you’re supposedly traversing through, having been mostly constructed with far too little subtleties to pique my curiosity. Compounded by the absolutely glacial speed I was travelling at, and I found myself making an early exit.

7.5 Weird and abrasive

Sonoshee’s 1-bit romp through existential hell is a grainy feast of monochromatic weirdness. It’s also absolutely brutal on the eyes, which sort of makes sense in the context of the game’s surreal terror and sinister themes… but even as a non-photosensitive person, I was only able to play it for 30 minutes at a time without a splitting headache.

The five sections take place across time and space in a universe made up of demonic forces, where perverse noidmen function as heralds of a larger and more nebulous apocalypse. From ancient Jordan to modern New York, it’s sort of like a taster menu of bizarro evil with multiple possible outcomes for each section, save the last. Each is named after an animal—Snake, Goat, Monkey, Spider, and Dragon—and marries elements of choose-your-own-adventure and old-school RPG features with a visual novel.

The game’s UI, which I otherwise love, also includes (for four sections) Chinese animal characters to evoke some kind of unknowable occult vibe. I understand that some designers believe this is a stylistic choice to create a harmless aesthetic flourish, or hint at the universal culture-spanning themes in the game narrative; Critters spans continents and cultures, dropping you off in far-flung remote Korean locations and the Jordanian desert.

But my kneejerk reaction to seeing Chinese characters in a magical occult setting is to sigh and roll my eyes and see if the all-too-common orientalist shortcut is “worth it”—sure, it’s not so much about the meaning of the words, but the distinct sense of otherness that these characters impart. But if your sweet-looking horror world can’t stand on its own two legs without random languages that make zero sense in the setting, 糟糕了 [ed’s note: this means “oh shit” in Mandarin].



Oh snap

That being said, Critters also avoids taking itself seriously, thank god—the game is peppered with goofy pop culture references, one-off jokes and fictional portrayals of real people (no spoilers here, but they’re pretty great in an alternate reality context). There are no real world-shattering revelations or complicated plot twists afoot, only well-dressed, lightly menacing (occasionally fatal) encounters with a galactic assortment of freaks and weirdos. If you’re looking for deep lore and heady chunks of exposition, this is not for you—in many ways Critters is an argument for knowing as little as possible about a game even while playing it.

The fourth and fifth chapters almost feel like a different game because things go off the rails a bit—you no longer seem to be inhabiting preset characters like in the previous sections—which helped give me a second wind to press on, despite my protesting eyeballs. At this point I felt like I’d gotten a tenuous grip on Critters’ internal mythology, which came into sharp focus in the final single-ending section, “Dragon,” which plays a bit like an all-star medley of point-and-click adventure puzzles: you’ll have to use a payphone, and write down and figure out bits of code.



Weird kinda hell

As you progress through the sections it becomes clear that Sonoshee’s two-toned project also doubles as a rollicking homage to the cosmic highs and lows of its excellent music choices—especially delightful amid the satisfying growl of Critters’ sound design (there are a couple of choice Theo Parrish tracks thrown in, and some great bits of UI audio that really complement the crunchy aesthetic). And of course, there’s the art. It’s gorgeous, in all its shimmering, noisy glory. It isn’t enough that Critters exists in another realm; it also feels like it was made there, too. Sonoshee has brought their chosen medium to new heights, particularly in hypnotic animations and hyper-stylised full-motion-video-style snippets that make Critters one of the most striking visual experiences around, even at moments where it feels shallow. Someone assembled the soundtrack on YouTube, by the way, and it rules.

The blindingly abrasive strobe effect that will make this an utterly miserable experience for some, no matter how much you want to see the pretty pictures and explore every corner of the Critters world. But if you’re willing to just ruin your vision for an afternoon and commit to the developer’s description of their own work “to make your eyes bleed” (for their other game, a shooter called Rym 9000), Critters for Sale is an oddball dip into a very particular vision of hell.",Critters for Sale Review

9 Well-written, funny, impressive

I’ve always loved games about ordinary people dealing with extraordinary situations. Look at The Banner Saga, for example, and you see a story about farmers, hunters, and herders, run-of-the-mill Norse villagers doing their best to deal with the end of the world. Mountains may break and serpents rise from the earth, but these characters still try to hold onto what they have. Yet victory always comes with a price: a mortal cost for immortal deeds.

Wildermyth is a tactics-based RPG that follows in the footsteps of The Banner Saga, but stakes its own claim with fantastic written scenarios and a smattering of roguelike elements. At its heart, Wildermyth is about taking a group of wide-eyed villagers and setting out to stall the apocalypse. Some will die, others will grow strong, and a few will return forever changed by the journey. Whatever happens, you’re in it till the end, as each chapter builds towards a climactic final battle.

On top of the five set narrative campaigns in Wildermyth, you can also play randomly generated campaigns or Legacy campaigns that allow you to use your favourite heroes from those you’ve previously completed. There are multiple ways to make a Legacy character: keep them alive until retirement, build a monument if they die, or choose them as your Legacy hero when the campaign finishes. It’s a great little feature that complements Wildermyth’s emergent character stories, letting you hold on to your personal favourites.

Bursting with personalities

The character creation system is also appealingly simple: you either roll a random character or choose three defining hooks and a class. This makes it easier for newly rolled characters to enter the game, but also adds an element of expendability as with old school renaissance tabletop RPGs. As characters defeat enemies they level up, letting you choose from a set of randomly selected class abilities. This adds a dash of roguelike synergy as you stack them to create powerful combos.

Procedurally-generated character stories are another defining factor of Wildermyth. As you travel around the game’s tile-based fantasy setting, the Yonderlands, you encounter all sorts of mysterious events and opportunities. These stories might happen before a battle, when you scout a new tile, or occur as side quests that you choose to undertake. Either way, they are fantastic bite-sized bits of character development that see your heroes wrangle with monsters and mystical phenomena.

They also showcase Wildermyth’s wonderfully thematic writing and tongue-in-cheek appreciation of the Norse fantasy setting. Over time these little moments come to define your heroes and are revisited in the ‘years of peace’—a narrative section between each chapter that reveals what your heroes are up to when they aren’t kicking ass and averting catastrophes.

Welcoming death

What stands out in Wildermyth’s character development is how it deals with death. When a character hits zero hit points in combat, they are forced to make a decision: run away and gain a permanent penalty, or go out in a blaze of glory dealing massive damage or buffing other characters. For me, it’s the perfect mechanical representation of that same Banner Saga concept: of tough choices and the reality of regular folk fighting mythical monsters. That permanent debuff encourages those heroic moments where a heroes’ sacrifice opens the way to victory.

There’s plenty of depth in Wildermyth’s classes, too. Warriors are bulwarks who deal massive damage and lock down chokepoints with reaction strike abilities. Archers employ stealth, lay traps, and use their ambush ability to overwatch. Best of all are Mystics, who ‘interfuse’ with objects on the battlefield and use them to attack enemies: be it exploding a table into a shower of splinters, using a lamp to set a tile alight, or entangling enemies with tree roots. Each distinctive papercraft-style battlefield is littered with destructible scenery that provides both cover and an opportunity to be weaponised by the Mystic.

But for every battle you win the enemy grows stronger, gaining a buff in the form of calamity cards. These roguelike-style escalations either add powerful units to the enemy roster or make pre-existing ones tougher. Your monstrous foes also launch incursions, sewing a path of destruction through friendly settlements and depriving you of the crafting resources needed to outfit your heroes.

On the whole I’m incredibly impressed with Wildermyth. While I was skeptical at first about whether its procedurally-generated narrative events and choices would allow for cohesive character development, its stories are so well-written, funny, and relatable that it’s hard not to be invested in the lives of your motley crew of heroes. Wildermyth is the kind of game that moves seamlessly between heroes making bad jokes one second and reflecting on the nature of existence the next. This tapestry of moments feels appropriate in a game about what it means to be human, both in terms of battling against mortality and the end of the world, but also in the quiet moments of beauty that life is filled with.",The Indie Game Website

6.5 Beautiful but stale

When I was a kid I had a children’s Bible that my dad would read to me, with pictures of Adam and Eve, the failed tower of Babylon, and Delilah cutting Samson’s hair. I absorbed these stories like a sponge; there was always a clear moral about choosing kindness over everything, but I was always really more into the pictures.

That’s my experience with Ultreia, a point-and-click adventure that follows a robot named Nymo, an adorable can-shaped robot with a bloodthirsty need to exact revenge on his father’s murderer. In order to find the man who murdered him, he sets out on a pilgrimage to the planet Ultreia for answers.

While the game is beautiful visually, the story doesn’t push itself as far as it could. Puzzles are fairly straightforward and satisfying, with its main attraction spending time in its muted dystopian setting.

A Dark and Beautiful World

Set in a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by robots, Ultreia looks both beautiful and haunting, from wiry robot birds taking flight, to machines still shambling along though they have been stripped to their bare parts. In stark contrast is the cute and shiny Nymo to the dark and seedy world he’s living in. The character designs for the robots are varied, with some resembling animals like mechanical octopuses and others sleek and human-like, and each one has its own unique voice clips, which is a nice touch that brings each individual character to life. Even in its dreariness, the world manages to have hints of lively charm.

Interacting with the game is easy, especially with the highlight feature which allows you to light up anything on screen that is interactable. This is great for me since I always feel like I miss pieces I need to complete puzzles in point-and-clicks, so it was nice to have that peace of mind. Ultreia also feels very streamlined in ways that older point-and-clicks may feel clunky. For example, they give you a mini-map and the ability to fast travel, particularly through the last and largest level of the game, which made the final puzzles much more enjoyable since I didn’t have to traverse manually.

The Cycle of Violence

Ultreia focuses on the cycle of violence and the consequences of being involved in its senselessness. In this world, an apocalypse wiped out almost all organic lifeforms, as it becomes solely inhabited by robots. But this new robotic world isn’t a perfect one. Instead of the well-oiled machines they were supposed to be, the robots seem to have the same vices that humans do, compelled to commit crimes and murder. The world of Ultreia thus becomes a warped mirror of our own, which is partially why I wish the story went further than it did.

Ultreia doesn’t shy away from portraying all kinds of violence such as physical, emotional and internal, but only blithely suggests the breaking of this cycle as a solution, without giving solace to the other kinds of suffering presented in the game. Throughout the story, Nymo is guided by a voice in his head that asks him to seek forgiveness over revenge. It attempts to impart the lesson of the pointlessness of revenge, but is too shallow to offer a satisfying resolution to Ultreia’s cruel world.

Ultreia, too, leans heavily on religious themes, with forgiveness being a saving grace that unlocks a secret true ending, reducing the story into an uncomplicated, religious tale with robots rather than a more nuanced story about adversities. It’s a pity that it ultimately misses the opportunities to delve deeper into the rich world it’s built for itself.",The Indie Game Website

5.5 Surreal but disjointed

Summertime Madness fits into a series of first-person art puzzlers that have been released over the past half-decade or so. These games are inspired by a specific visual art aesthetic, with that translated art becoming a space that the player moves through. In order to buffer out the time that the player is moving through the space, puzzles entice the player to spend more time in the space running repeatedly through similar areas. It would fit snugly in-between Vladimir Kudelka’s Rememoried and Giant Sparrow’s The Unfinished Swan.

Summertime Madness fits snuggly alongside the two with an aim of creating a world based in the visuals of European surrealism. Following a Praguian painter in the midst of World War II, he is offered a deal to escape into his paintings only if he can return to the real world by midnight. Inside, buildings stretch into the sky to touch the moon, hallways stretch on infinitely, and statues stand in liquid voids of darkness.

What’s unique to the visual choices of the game is that a large part of the world is translated from surrealist art into 3D space. Entire rooms display their inspiration such as a section of endless stairways paralleling M.C. Escher’s Relativity. This art can also appear very literally as a virtual copy, for instance René Magritte’s sky-filled silhouette from Décalcomanie appearing on a wall. Yet, none of these inclusions are ever given any larger meaning outside of the fairly standard plot of the painter’s escape. Rather, in what Esther Rosenfield calls “a container for reference points” in writing about Ghosts of Tsushima. There is no aesthetic meaning to take away from the collection of surrealist images rendered by the game; instead, they are placed to create recognition and spectacle.

Rather than thinking of this as the game failing to translate this aesthetic however, it transforms from an atmospheric first-person experience to something more comparable to an art gallery. The player walks into a room, works through puzzles over an hour or so, and throughout the process sees various artworks.

Looking around the Gallery

As Zolani Stewart has written, games have historically and continued to fail presenting images for the comfort of prioritising environmental information. I’m considering this as an art gallery because I don’t want to discount the inherent value in walking around these environments. The game doesn’t “fail” to make me think because I have to process the game’s images in order to move through it. Despite the lack of cohesion between all of the pieces existing within the world space, they still make you feel something by just moving through them. The spiraling hallway of infinity makes me dizzy and question time, the spatialisation of Dali’s The Persistence of Memory catches my eye because it is out of place. Seeing something in a game does make me feel something because games are a haptic-visual form. However, there is a difference between art being placed in a space for aesthetic expression versus being spatialised for environmental spectacle.

In a similar fashion, perhaps we can imagine an art gallery in the flatiron district of New York City owned by an oil baron heiress. Art that was purchased by a series of millionaires line the walls with only a slight string of connections between each work. The space is designed to attract guests and possible donors whether it’s through a plain white box or an immersive series of rooms. The works will be seen by some who possibly have historical connections or interest in a piece, but many will come to just be in the space with a famous work or for the space itself without taking away much to remember at all.

Between the two, the major difference is the fact that one exists wholly in a virtual world and the other in real space. Both place art within an aestheticised space for the pleasure of their spectacle.

Image Prevention

Summertime Madness also struggles with its form as a surrealist art gallery within a video game because it still remains entrenched in conservative video game design. Art does not exist in the environment to just be viewed, but the ability to view must be rewarded for solving cryptic puzzles. However, these puzzles are either never connected to the surrounding artwork or being used to express a general concept without too much to look deeper into.

For example, a reoccurring moment that occurs throughout the game is a dark void where a statue represents an emotional aspect of the painter’s life. One of them, representing love, renders a statue of two figures holding each other and kissing. When the player moves closer, the statues disintegrate and reveal their hearts. The player must then balance two scales evenly with flowers for them to recover and reveal a stairwell to progress. This doesn’t reveal anything about the character, at most just making a statement about balance being the key to a healthy relationship–if at all.

When these puzzles aren’t as easy, gameplay consists of walking around areas repeatedly to turn on different combinations of switches across the map. During these moments, I found myself losing a lot of focus on the art in the world because I was so frustrated with the design of the puzzles. This would start from a place of accepting that the puzzles were a sort of vehicle for each expanse of art, then hoping I could just be given a solution and see the next piece.

During these times, I felt more like a program running through solutions, blindly rushing through the terrain in a haze. After a certain point of running around the same corner so many times it didn’t matter what the space looked like.

Selfie Artist

Moving through Summertime Madness, the art gallery comparison reminded me more and more of an art pop up in Manhattan called Color Factory. In Color Factory, guests move through spaces of bright, saturated, colorful designs of atmospheric spaces, playful ball pits and selfie-perfect sets with slogan-plastered objects ready for instagram. The more I walked through the colorful playspaces of Summertime Madness, the more fitting the connection seemed. Rather than thinking of some video games through a cinematic lens or painting frame, Summertime Madness is a reminder of real world spaces like Color Factory. While that isn’t too lofty an aspiration, maybe just walking through a world and feeling something is enough.",Summertime Madness Review

6 Soaring fun

I became a pilot around ten years ago today. What I really wanted to experience at the time was the feeling of flight, but what I wound up discovering was that flying an airplane is mostly a matter of managing your motor. The only time I found that flight experience I was looking for was when shutting down the engine while practicing forced landings. You wouldn’t believe how far an airplane can fly without engine power–which led me to the sport often called gliding, but technically known as soaring.

The principle is to use rising currents of air to keep yourself aloft for the longest possible length of time. Since they don’t use engine power to keep them in the air, flying a glider comes pretty close to being a bird. You’re literally flying by the seat of your pants. In other words, you have to feel your way around the sky. Are you climbing or descending? What angle of bank are you at? Gliders are heavier than air, so they always come back down to the ground eventually. Stonefly manages to capture this experience by giving you a gliding mech. You’re constantly trying to judge your distances and plan your touchdown points. The game is all about the feeling of flight.

Stonefly has really good gliding. When you’re in the air the game is a joy to play, but when you’re on the ground it can be a bit of a bore. The bulk of Stonefly is crafting and combat, which are two surprisingly in-depth systems. I would even go so far as to say that both are just a little bit too deep, which gives me the sense that Stonefly suffers from a mild case of feature creep. The crafting, for example, consists of improving your mech in a variety of ways that range from cosmetic modifications to special abilities by way of improved performance. There are several development trees with an overly complicated number of steps between stages. You’re always missing a tool or something. In order to craft anything, you, of course, have to collect a variety of different resources, too. The game forces you to grind your way through all of this on more than one occasion.

Fighter planes

Then there’s the combat. There are far more special abilities to unlock than seems necessary, which results in overly complicated combat. This entails knocking out bugs with bombs, and then pushing them over the edge of a platform while repairing any damage that your mech may have sustained in the process. The problem is that you have so many special abilities to juggle in addition to bombing and pushing, that fighting winds up being more frantic than fun. You stumble over yourself a lot as you search for the right buttons to press while trying to remain airborne. The bugs don’t stay knocked out for long, so time plays a part in things, too. The combat is just too much to handle.

Stonefly, on the other hand, shines when it comes to the aesthetics. The developer, Flight School Studio, somehow managed to reconcile the intricacy of nature with the minimalism of modernism in all of the artwork. Skimming over the pastel colors of the landscape in your mech is a real pleasure. The leaves on the trees are lovely shades of red, yellow, and green. The water is a beautiful blue. The animations are nice and fluid for the most part. Your mech springs up into the air in a very satisfying way. The environment is three dimensional, but the fixed perspective makes the place appear like some sort of isometric projection, almost as though you’re playing around inside a painting.

The problem, however, is that you can’t find your way around the game world very well, because you’re looking down at the ground all the time. The game gets around this problem with tracker flies that point you towards the next objective, but the fixed perspective is a bit of a bother for another reason. Your view can be either partially or even completely blocked when flying below trees or bushes–a tad annoying, but otherwise forgivable in light of the level design. The music mirrors the artwork in a lot of ways, which is best described as being somewhere between experimental jazz and electronica. The sound effects include a wonderful bunch of beeps and boops that make bouncing around rather pleasant.

Not too much story

The story in Stonefly is delightful in terms of theme, but shallow in terms of narrative. The former is all about what it would be like for tiny people to live in trees–throw a couple of mechs into the mix and you’ve got yourself a pretty solid setup. The possibilities are just about endless when it comes to worldbuilding and lore. Why is everybody so small? How did they develop this technology? The latter is unfortunately nothing more than a pretext for the mechanics; there just isn’t that much going on at the narrative level. You play as a girl named Annika who leaves a garage door unlocked and winds up with a stolen mech. Annika sets out in search of this particular machine and soon finds herself teaming up with a squadron of pilots called the Acorn Corps. The narrative is flimsy on the whole and falls into more than its fair share of tropes and clichés; Annika has ran away from home because she thinks that her father won’t forgive her for losing the mech, only to find out that her disappearance threw him into a panic. While it might string you along for a bit, the narrative definitely doesn’t immerse you into the world of Stonefly, which is kind of a shame. The narrative touches on issues like rejection and belonging, but does so without delving deeper into these personal problems–a missed opportunity.

I really like Stonefly, but some frustrations really hold it back. When it flies it soars, but when it stumbles it falls flat. That said, the game is a good way to spend five or six hours, but you can expect some turbulence along the way. What impresses me the most about Stonefly is how closely it captures the sensation of soaring. I’m not sure what sort of magic Flight School Studio used to make it happen, but when you glide around the game world in your mech, you just feel incredibly free.

The rest of the game, unfortunately, doesn’t match up to this. Just like the sport of soaring, while everything is great when you’re up in the air, the fun comes to a screeching halt when you’re down on the ground. Cruising around on those rising currents of air is an incredible experience that truly captures the feeling of flight. You can sometimes keep your glider aloft for hours by weaving around the sky in just the right way. When you touch down, there’s no getting yourself back up into the air, though. Flight School Studio was on to something with all the gliding, but didn’t quite stick the landing.",The Indie Game Website
